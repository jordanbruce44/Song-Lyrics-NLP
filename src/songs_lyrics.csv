About spending that whole sunny day inside

They were driving down a backroad
They thought they were home free
The police knew they were coming
They were hiding in the trees
And they shot them down
One hundred and thirty rounds
They shot them down

He doesn't want to make it cry or sing
Yes and an old guitar is all he can afford
When he gets up under the lights to play his thing

I was born in a messed-up century
My favourite flavoured sweets are raspberry amphetamines
I bought a car, Beretta, age sixteen
I brush my teeth with bleach 'cause I ain't got time for cavities
My daddy put a gun to my head
Said, ""If you kiss a boy, I'm gonna shoot you dead""
So I tied him up with gaffer tape and I locked him in a shed
Then I went out to the garden and I fucked my best friend


'Cause my high hopes are getting low
Because these people are so old
The way they think about it all
If I tried, I would never know

(Ah, when it ring-a-ling, it only mean one thing, come on)
Dial that number, no one answers
'Til it's two o'clock


And if by chance, you just come on over, girl
I'm sick and, please, I've got to see you, baby
Ooh, when in need, you said you would be right here
Well, I'm in need, I need you to please believe, please believe
I love you, baby!


If you are that special lover (Woo)
And love keeps you tied to another
That's the way it goes on love's train
(You don't need no, you don't need no ticket to ride, ah)
Sometimes, heartstrings can be broken
But you just have to keep on goin'
That's the way it goes on love's train
(Listen, baby, listen, baby)
If deep sorrow, you been soakin'
But you just have to keep on strokin'
That's the way it goes on love's train
(Love's a hurtin' thang, yo, it makes you wanna cry, come on)

And love keeps you tied to another

And two left feet, you know I always drop
First thing a girl did was a bop
I'm the whole damn cake and the cherry on top
Shook up the bottle, made a good girl pop


You ain't even here to party
Ken in the club, tryna pipe a Barbie
I don't wanna go, go, go with the flow
Backbend 'til I touch my toes
I don't wanna row, row, row the boat
Wrist full of rocks and I hope I float
Big up yourself 'cause you know they don't
I chew, chew, chew 'cause they hope I choke

Brighter than a blue sky
She's got you mesmerized while I die


Why would you ever kiss me?
I'm not even half as pretty
You gave her your sweater, it's just polyester
But you like her better, wish I were Heather

Watch as she stands with her holding your hand
Put your arm 'round her shoulder, now I'm getting colder
But how could I hate her? She's such an angel
But then again, kinda wish she were dead as she

(Holla if you feel like you've been down the same road) Just follow me, I'll get you there


You can try and read my lyrics off of this paper before I lay 'em
But you won't take the sting out these words before I say 'em
'Cause ain't no way I'ma let you stop me from causin' mayhem
When I say I'ma do somethin', I do it
I don't give a damn what you think, I'm doin' this for me
So fuck the world, feed it beans, it's gassed up if it thinks it's stoppin' me
I'ma be what I set out to be, without a doubt, undoubtedly
And all those who look down on me, I'm tearin' down your balcony
No ifs, ands or buts, don't try to ask him why or how can he
From Infinite down to the last Relapse album
He's still shittin' whether he's on salary, paid hourly
Until he bows out or he shits his bowels out of him
Whichever comes first, for better or worse
He's married to the game
Like a ""fuck you"" for Christmas, his gift is a curse
Forget the Earth, he's got the urge to pull his dick from the dirt
And fuck the whole universe

Holla if you feel like you've been down the same road


Okay, quit playin' with the scissors and shit, and cut the crap
I shouldn't have to rhyme these words in a rhythm for you to know it's a wrap
You said you was king, you lied through your teeth
For that, fuck your feelings, instead of gettin' crowned, you're gettin' capped
And to the fans, I'll never let you down again, I'm back
I promise to never go back on that promise
In fact, let's be honest, that last Relapse CD was ""ehh""
Perhaps I ran them accents into the ground
Relax, I ain't goin' back to that now
All I'm tryna say is get back, click-clack-blaow!
'Cause I ain't playin' around
There's a game called circle and I don't know how
I'm way too up to back down
But I think I'm still tryna figure this crap out
Thought I had it mapped out, but I guess I didn't
This fuckin' black cloud still follows me around
But it's time to exorcise these demons
These ma'fuckers are doin' jumpin' jacks now

I'm standin' up, I'ma face my demons
I'm mannin' up, I'ma hold my ground
I've had enough, now I'm so fed up
Time to put my life back together right now


It was my decision to get clean, I did it for me
Admittedly I probably did it subliminally for you
So I could come back a brand-new me, you helped see me through
And don't even realize what you did, believe me, you
I've been through the wringer
But they can do little to the middle finger
I think I got a tear in my eye, I feel like the king of
My world, haters can make like bees with no stingers
And drop dead: no more beef lingers
No more drama from now on
I promise to focus solely on handlin' my responsibilities as a father
So I solemnly swear to always treat this roof like my daughters and raise it
You couldn't lift a single shingle on it
'Cause the way I feel, I'm strong enough to go to the club
Or the corner pub and lift the whole liquor counter up
'Cause I'm raisin' the bar, I'd shoot for the moon
But I'm too busy gazin' at stars, I feel amazin', and

I'm not afraid, I'm not afraid
To take a stand, to take a stand

Reaping everything I sow, karma coming heavy
No preliminary hearing on my record
Tell 'em I'm a gangster in silence for the record, uh

Drown inside my vices all day
Won't you please believe when I—
Won't you please believe when I—

If you had one shot
One opportunity to seize everything you ever wanted
One moment—would you capture it?


His palms are sweaty, knees weak, arms are heavy
There's vomit on his sweater already, mom's spaghetti
He's nervous, but on the surface he looks calm and ready
To drop bombs, but he keeps on forgetting
What he wrote down, the whole crowd goes so loud
He opens his mouth, but the words won't come out
He's choking, how? Everybody's joking now
The clock's run out, time's up, over—blaow!
Snap back to reality, ope there goes gravity, ope
There goes Rabbit, he choked, he's so mad but he won't
Give up that easy, no, he won't have it, he knows
His whole back's to these ropes, it don't matter, he's dope
He knows that but he's broke, he's so stagnant, he knows
When he goes back to this mobile home, that's when it's
Back to the lab again yo, this old rhapsody
Better go capture this moment and hope it don't pass him, and


You better lose yourself in the music
The moment, you own it, you better never let it go (Go!)
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime, yo

'Cause it feels so empty without me


Little hellions, kids feeling rebellious
Embarrassed, their parents still listen to Elvis
They start feelin' like prisoners, helpless
'Til someone comes along on a mission and yells, ""Bitch!""
A visionary, vision is scary
Could start a revolution, pollutin' the airwaves
A rebel, so just let me revel and bask
In the fact that I got everyone kissin' my ass
And it's a disaster, such a catastrophe
For you to see so damn much of my ass, you asked for me?
Well, I'm back, da-na-na-na, na-na-na-na-na-na
Fix your bent antenna, tune it in, and then I'm gonna
Enter in and up under your skin like a splinter
The center of attention, back for the winter
I'm interesting, the best thing since wrestling
Infesting in your kid's ears and nesting
Testing, ""Attention, please""
Feel the tension soon as someone mentions me
Here's my ten cents, my two cents is free
A nuisance, who sent? You sent for me?

Now, this looks like a job for me
So everybody, just follow me
'Cause we need a little controversy
'Cause it feels so empty without me
I said this looks like a job for me

'Cause we need a little controversy

A tisket, a tasket, I'll go tit-for-tat wit'
Anybody who's talkin', ""This shit, that shit""
Chris Kirkpatrick, you can get your ass kicked
Worse than them little Limp Bizkit bastards
And Moby? You can get stomped by Obie
You thirty-six-year-old bald-headed fag, blow me
You don't know me, you're too old, let go
It's over, nobody listens to techno
Now, let's go, just give me the signal
I'll be there with a whole list full of new insults
I've been dope, suspenseful with a pencil
Ever since Prince turned himself into a symbol
But, sometimes, the shit just seems
Everybody only wants to discuss me
So this must mean I'm disgusting
But it's just me, I'm just obscene (Yeah)
Though I'm not the first king of controversy
I am the worst thing since Elvis Presley
To do Black music so selfishly
And use it to get myself wealthy (Hey!)
There's a concept that works
Twenty million other white rappers emerge
But no matter how many fish in the sea
It'd be so empty without me

Now, this looks like a job for me
So everybody, just follow me
'Cause we need a little controversy
'Cause it feels so empty without me

Back in the time when I was lacking a dime
My hopeless youth had me slowly get attracted to crime
Then sat an alliance to talk it out with practical
Minds
Felt a force within me get all my talents combined
Enacted a mime, enlightened I decided to rhyme
Delighted and excited. I'm planning to rap till I'm
Prime
Started spilling ink on the paper and planned to get
Signed
But the world is biased, so wild, they got me slapped
With a fine
I never got a chance, Never let me spit on the mic
Only cuz I come from a land where people ain't white
Day and night I keep flowing, completing all my demo
Tracks
Inspite being denied the right by anti-democrats
Unleash my rage through Music intense

I could've got myself in dealing with drugs
Or maybe pop a weaker person dead while chilling with

Maybe, blow up my father's money spending on clothes
Fake an attitude for winning all em feminine votes
One point of time, I got absorbed in foolish lies
Was juvenile, thought it was cool to get into brutal
Fights
I even had the thrilling urge to kill

Cyclic monotony for me is cursed as debt

Death

And have a million people chanting, Brodha V you rock
And maybe, wish to have a girl like Emma Watson

Your bitch in here, she gettin' tossed
Baguettes on my neck look like frost
I'm bustin' checks in the office
I play defense and offеnse
Run up, you get steppеd on, I'm a demon, I throw crosses
Run down with my vest on, no such thing as being too cautious
I took all my losses to the chin and then I charged it
Fresh out of prison, I'm already spinnin', I'm right back where I started
.223s in the cartridge
5.56s and switches
Ain't sparin' none of you bitches
Want sympathy, ain't gettin' it from me

Jaws all on the floor like Pam, like Tommy just burst in the door
And started whoopin' her ass worse than before
They first were divorced, throwin' her over furniture (Agh!)
It's the return of the ""Oh, wait, no way, you're kidding
He didn't just say what I think he did, did he?""
And Dr. Dre said
Nothing, you idiots, Dr. Dre's dead, he's locked in my basement (Ha-ha!)

""Chicka-chicka-chicka, Slim Shady, I'm sick of him
Look at him, walkin' around, grabbin' his you-know-what
Flippin' the you-know-who"", ""Yeah, but he's so cute though""
Yeah, I probably got a couple of screws up in my head loose
But no worse than what's goin' on in your parents' bedrooms
Sometimes I wanna get on TV and just let loose
But can't, but it's cool for Tom Green to hump a dead moose
""My bum is on your lips, my bum is on your lips""
And if I'm lucky, you might just give it a little kiss
And that's the message that we deliver to little kids
And expect them not to know what a woman's clitoris is
Of course, they're gonna know what intercourse is
By the time they hit fourth grade they've got the Discovery Channel, don't they?
We ain't nothin' but mammals
Well, some of us cannibals who cut other people open like cantaloupes
But if we can hump dead animals and antelopes
Then there's no reason that a man and another man can't elope
But if you feel like I feel, I got the antidote

Why? So you guys could just lie to get me here?
So you can sit me here next to Britney Spears?

So I have been sent here to destroy you

I'm like a head trip to listen to 'cause I'm only givin' you
Things you joke about with your friends inside your livin' room
The only difference is I got the balls to say it in front of y'all
And I don't gotta be false or sugarcoat it at all
I just get on the mic and spit it
And whether you like to admit it (Err), I just shit it
Better than ninety percent of you rappers out can
Then you wonder: ""How can kids eat up these albums like Valiums?""
It's funny, 'cause at the rate I'm goin', when I'm thirty
I'll be the only person in the nursin' home flirting
Pinchin' nurse's asses when I'm jacking off with Jergens
And I'm jerking, but this whole bag of Viagra isn't working
And every single person is a Slim Shady lurkin'
He could be working at Burger King, spittin' on your onion rings (Ch, puh)
Or in the parkin' lot, circling, screaming, ""I don't give a fuck!""
With his windows down and his system up
So will the real Shady please stand up
And put one of those fingers on each hand up?
And be proud to be outta your mind and outta control
And one more time, loud as you can, how does it go?

I'm Slim Shady, yes, I'm the real Shady

So let me explain what is the actual plot
Eminem created kill shot; you made that kill shot as bull shot
I’ve no hope, maybe one day my song archive actual jackpot
All the people diss me, some I remember, some I forgot
I forgot all, but I request you forgot-me-not
Because I was made a flop song which name is killing shot?

Motherfucker, you know nothing, you yell more
I’m sorry wait
I find lot of shit rappers, you know what?
They say I know everything; the truth is I’m only great
You hate what I make
I thought I’d say nothing at first but now I can’t tolerate
I archive your hate
What’s your talent?
Oh critiquing
My talent Oh bitch
I don’t know
You mention me, millions of views
You get attention in news
I mention you, I’ve no views
I make best songs, but I’m not in any news
First I made songs, people said you need reviews

Don’t get misconstrued, so get this shit to do
You always hate me, when I need you

Not even dissing it just ain’t for me
I search Indian rap, I found a shit rapper just like MC

I write my all songs with a cup of tea
But maybe you’re cup is full of syrup and lean
Maybe I made best song but they don’t give attention because they can’t beat me


You want to make me ill

I don’t like mumble, I like hard trap beat
When I release a song, you just hate it
I’m basically independent artist; give the support
But I’m not mumble, just like m-u-m-b-l-e


In the past I made songs that are classic
But the real position of your song is my dick
Make a song about who you have a wide lipstick
You’re mumble so you don’t care about your lyrics

Now I’m professional, I know actual tactic
Why dissolve me? So you want to fuck my bitch? (Suck my dick)

He makes nasty songs that people tell him fantastic
The music you make doesn’t read generic

Indian rappers are doesn’t understand rap they just understand what is their profit
But seriously I’m not understand how they fuck the track

But last week, an ex-fan mailed me a copy of the matters LP
To tell me to study and learn something (wooooo)

I mailed the bitch back and said if I did that
I’d kill your hip-hop industry, bitch you’re don’t know me (yeaaaah)

So
Finger bang, chicken Wang
Old boy, Emiway
Everybody in the game
So I mentioned you anyway
Doesn’t matter what I say
Because give me donkey other day
What a way for 2019 to get underway
But I’m gonna say everything that I wanna say
Because I’m always a humble
You don’t do anything else, just drink a bottle
I don’t participate in fucking battle
Because I’m always winner in your fucking battle
Honey Singh like mumble, but I’m sorry I like lyrical
Maybe I can be hit, but believe me always I’m casual
I saw everywhere motherfucking couple
You can be devil, but bitch I’m also evil
You don’t concentrate your rap; you just concentrate about your facial
I was make song gamble with my imagination but now I see you’re a real gamble
Now I’m an English rapper but I diss a Hindi and Bengali rapper
I know bitch it’s completely legal
You can’t understand what is my level
Because for me you’re too little
Some drinks too, and make himself a mental
I’m the best English rapper and I’m always normal
I know diss song is harmful and painful
Now I make this situation because I want kill you peaceful

But saying I no longer got it caused you missed a line and never caught it cause it went over your head
Because you’re too stupid to get it cause you’re mentally retarded
You can’t make something with proper languages; you just hit the bottle, and now you why you speared
When I said I like music and I’ll kill hip-hop industry so now time is come to broke your fucking forehead
But you’ll never be artist and I’m harder on I than you could ever be regardless
What I’ll be never in flow less
Even all rappers are busy to get new song but you’re busy in fucking alcoholic
But after you come back you don’t change you again with fucking alcoholic
And you interest in fucking mumble

Mumble is my bitch
And you are shit
Do you have any songs that new generations need?
I get in beefs, my enemies die, I don’t ceased
Fire till at least all are decreased
I’m west side, I know you fuck better old boy east side
You got some fucking fans that’s have no guide
When I sing better they cried because they feel like they died
Ok I know you all understand
But you don’t what is actual bitch

Aw man!
The crypt cypher was weak
It was garbage the thing ain’t even arrange
Oh my god that’s a reach

Every fuck up rappers who don’t understand what is rap
They always said my rap is shit
I’m not believe god, because I’m the believe I’m the god
Some people diss me all the time
But believe me I’m don’t give a fuck

So
Finger bang, chicken Wang
Old boy, Emiway
Everybody in the game
So I mentioned you anyway
Doesn’t matter what I say
Because give me donkey other day
What a way for 2019 to get underway
But I’m gonna say everything that I wanna say

You motherfucker how you sing, I’ll diss you an another way
On the other side, I’m a producer, I already make the way


Welcome Krishna, bitch
Invite me in your house one day
I’m not done

I’m not diss you as your way
I’ll diss you an another way
Because I’m not diss you, I want to teach you
I’m here previous one year so don’t call me new
I made this song, it will long song it’s 5:32
Maybe I’m late, but believe me I’m old, I’m not new
Now you destroy all songs, now what people do?
You make loca, one bottle down now you need review
You don’t understand what is actual hip-hop, how you said I’m huge
Other rappers has fucking tattoo
But I’m interested in fresh skin, I’ve no tattoos
I know this rap will end but my diss will be continue
Indian rappers always make fucking songs
And media always make motherfucking news

Hold up hold up hold up
I said media always make actual news

I make songs but they just can to abuse
Explicit is my song, but you like always bamboos
You gave the name song is and you sing another I’m confuse
Indian rappers are don’t know what is actual rap, so they give you overviews

You’ll give a fucking dislike to this video
But bitch you goes angry, you don’t understand actual meaning if the video
I was hear what you sing in your fucking show
You can’t sing you start your song as yo, yo
I don’t know what the fuck other pop singers said, but my flow is overflow
I’m an English rapper, I’ve a dictionary, and I’m in fucking blow
Obviously I’m psycho
I’m psycho about my rap
You all not my same, you’re half
When I sing rap obviously you motherfucking people laugh
And you said I’m not sing rap, I’ve no proper languages
But now you need to mouth shut"

'Til I collapse I'm spillin' these raps long as you feel 'em
'Til the day that I drop you'll never say that I'm not killin' 'em
'Cause when I am not, then I'ma stop pennin' 'em
And I am not hip-hop and I'm just not Eminem
Subliminal thoughts, when I'ma stop sendin' 'em?
Women are caught in webs, spin 'em and hock venom
Adrenaline shots of penicillin could not get the illin' to stop
Amoxicillin's just not real enough
The criminal, cop-killin', hip-hop villain
A minimal swap to cop millions of Pac listeners
You're comin' with me, feel it or not
You're gonna fear it like I showed ya the spirit of God lives in us
You hear it a lot, lyrics to shock
Is it a miracle or am I just product of pop fizzin' up?

Music is like magic, there's a certain feelin' you get
When you real and you spit, and people are feelin' your shit
This is your moment, and every single minute you spend
Tryna hold on to it, 'cause you may never get it again
So while you're in it, try to get as much shit as you can
And when your run is over, just admit when it's at its end
'Cause I'm at the end of my wits with half the shit that gets in
I got a list, here's the order of my list that it's in
It goes: Reggie, Jay-Z, 2Pac and Biggie
André from OutKast, Jada, Kurupt, Nas, and then me
But in this industry I'm the cause of a lot of envy
So when I'm not put on this list, the shit does not offend me
That's why you see me walk around like nothing's botherin' me
Even though half you people got a fuckin' problem with me
You hate it, but you know respect you got to give me
The press's wet dream, like Bobby and Whitney — Nate, hit me!

'Til the roof comes off, 'til the lights go out
'Til my legs give out, can't shut my mouth
'Til the smoke clears out, am I high? Perhaps
I'ma rip this shit 'til my bones collapse

I'ma rip this shit 'til my bones collapse (Give out from underneath me)


Soon as a verse starts, I eat at an MC's heart
What is he thinking? How not to go against me, smart
And it's absurd how people hang on every word
I'll prob'ly never get the props I feel I ever deserve
But I'll never be served, my spot is forever reserved
If I ever leave Earth, that would be the death of me first
'Cause in my heart of hearts I know nothin' could ever be worse
That's why I'm clever when I put together every verse
My thoughts are sporadic, I act like I'm an addict
I rap like I'm addicted to smack like I'm Kim Mathers
But I don't wanna go forth and back in constant battles
The fact is I would rather sit back and bomb some rappers
So this is like a full-blown attack I'm launchin' at 'em
The track is on some battlin' raps, who wants some static?
'Cause I don't really think that the fact that I'm Slim matters
A plaque and platinum status is wack if I'm not the baddest, so

'Til the roof comes off, 'til the lights go out
'Til my legs give out, can't shut my mouth
'Til the smoke clears out, am I high? Perhaps
I'ma rip this shit 'til my bones collapse
'Til the roof comes off, 'til the lights go out ('Til the roof, until the roof)
'Til my legs give out, can't shut my mouth (The roof comes off, the roof comes off)
'Til the smoke clears out, am I high? Perhaps ('Til my legs, until my legs)
I'ma rip this shit 'til my bones collapse (Give out from underneath me)


Until the roof, until the roof
The roof comes off, the roof comes off
Until my legs, until my legs
Give out from underneath me, I
I will not fall, I will stand tall
Feels like no one can beat me"

And right now, there's a steel knife in my windpipe

As long as the wrong feels right, it's like I'm in flight
High off her love, drunk from her hate
It's like I'm huffin' paint and I love her, the more I suffer, I suffocate
And right before I'm about to drown, she resuscitates me
She fuckin' hates me, and I love it — ""Wait!
Where you going?"" — ""I'm leaving you!"" — ""No, you ain't!
Come back!"" — We're runnin' right back, here we go again
It's so insane, 'cause when it's goin' good, it's goin' great
I'm Superman with the wind at his back, she's Lois Lane
But when it's bad, it's awful, I feel so ashamed

You push, pull each other's hair, scratch, claw, bit 'em
Throw 'em down, pin 'em

It's the rage that took over, it controls you both
So they say you're best to go your separate ways
Guess that they don't know ya
'Cause today, that was yesterday, yesterday is over
It's a different day, sound like broken records playin' over

Come back, it wasn't you, baby, it was me
Maybe our relationship isn't as crazy as it seems
Maybe that's what happens when a tornado meets a volcano

Come inside, pick up your bags off the sidewalk
Don't you hear sincerity in my voice when I talk?
Told you this is my fault, look me in the eyeball
Next time I'm pissed, I'll aim my fist at the drywall
Next time? There won't be no next time!
I apologize, even though I know it's lies
I'm tired of the games, I just want her back, I know I'm a liar

Thoughts tellin' me I'm lost gettin' too loud
Had to see a therapist, then I found out

Been makin' a whole lot of changes
Wrote a song about that, you should play it
I get scared when I walk on these stages
I look at the crowd and see so many faces, yeah

I'm beginnin' to feel like a Rap God, Rap God
All my people from the front to the back nod, back nod
Now, who thinks their arms are long enough to slap box, slap box?
They said I rap like a robot, so call me Rap-bot

But for me to rap like a computer it must be in my genes
I got a laptop in my back pocket
My pen'll go off when I half-cock it
Got a fat knot from that rap profit
Made a livin' and a killin' off it
Ever since Bill Clinton was still in office
With Monica Lewinsky feelin' on his nutsack
I'm an MC still as honest
But as rude and as indecent as all hell
Syllables, skill-a-holic (Kill 'em all with)
This flippity dippity-hippity hip-hop
You don't really wanna get into a pissin' match
With this rappity brat, packin' a MAC in the back of the Ac'
Backpack rap crap, yap-yap, yackety-yack
And at the exact same time, I attempt these lyrical acrobat stunts while I'm practicin' that
I'll still be able to break a motherfuckin' table
Over the back of a couple of faggots and crack it in half
Only realized it was ironic, I was signed to Aftermath after the fact
How could I not blow? All I do is drop F-bombs
Feel my wrath of attack

Well, to be truthful the blueprint's

Hit the Earth like an asteroid
Did nothing but shoot for the Moon since (Pew!)

Yella, Eazy, thank you, they got Slim
Inspired enough to one day grow up, blow up and be in a position
To meet Run–D.M.C., and induct them
Into the motherfuckin' Rock and Roll Hall of Fame
Even though I'll walk in the church and burst in a ball of flames
Only Hall of Fame I'll be inducted in is the alcohol of fame
On the wall of shame
You fags think it's all a game, 'til I walk a flock of flames
Off a plank and, tell me what in the fuck are you thinkin'?

So gay I can barely say it with a straight face, lookin' boy (Ha-ha!)

Basically, boy, you're never gonna be capable
Of keepin' up with the same pace, lookin' boy, 'cause—

I'm beginnin' to feel like a Rap God, Rap God
All my people from the front to the back nod, back nod
The way I'm racin' around the track, call me NASCAR, NASCAR
Dale Earnhardt of the trailer park, the White Trash God
Kneel before General Zod
This planet's Krypton—no, Asgard, Asgard


So you'll be Thor and I'll be Odin
You rodent, I'm omnipotent
Let off, then I'm reloadin'
Immediately with these bombs I'm totin'
And I should not be woken
I'm the walkin' dead, but I'm just a talkin' head, a zombie floatin'
But I got your mom deep-throatin'
I'm out my Ramen Noodle
We have nothin' in common, poodle
I'm a Doberman, pinch yourself in the arm and pay homage, pupil
It's me, my honesty's brutal
But it's honestly futile if I don't utilize what I do though
For good at least once in a while
So I wanna make sure somewhere in this chicken scratch I scribble and doodle enough rhymes
To maybe try to help get some people through tough times
But I gotta keep a few punchlines
Just in case 'cause even you unsigned
Rappers are hungry lookin' at me like it's lunchtime
I know there was a time where once I
Was king of the underground
But I still rap like I'm on my Pharoahe Monch grind
So I crunch rhymes, but sometimes when you combine
Appeal with the skin color of mine
You get too big and here they come tryin'
To censor you like that one line
I said on ""I'm Back"" from The Mathers LP 1 when I
Tried to say I'll take seven kids from Columbine
Put 'em all in a line, add an AK-47, a revolver and a 9
See if I get away with it now that I ain't as big as I was, but I'm
Morphin' into an immortal, comin' through the portal
You're stuck in a time warp from 2004 though
And I don't know what the fuck that you rhyme for
You're pointless as Rapunzel with fuckin' cornrows
You write normal? Fuck being normal!
And I just bought a new raygun from the future
Just to come and shoot ya, like when Fabolous made Ray J mad
'Cause Fab said he looked like a fag at Mayweather's pad
Singin' to a man while he played piano
Man, oh man, that was a 24/7 special on the cable channel
So Ray J went straight to the radio station
The very next day, ""Hey Fab, I'ma kill you!""
Lyrics comin' at you at supersonic speed (J.J. Fad)
Uh, summa-lumma, dooma-lumma, you assumin' I'm a human
What I gotta do to get it through to you? I'm superhuman
Innovative and I'm made of rubber so that anything you say is ricochetin' off of me and it'll glue to you and
I'm devastating, more than ever demonstrating
How to give a motherfuckin' audience a feeling like it's levitating
Never fading, and I know the haters are forever waiting
For the day that they can say I fell off, they'll be celebrating
'Cause I know the way to get 'em motivated
I make elevating music, you make elevator music
""Oh, he's too mainstream.""
Well, that's what they do when they get jealous, they confuse it
""It's not hip-hop, it's pop,""—'cause I found a hella way to fuse it
With rock, shock rap with Doc
Throw on ""Lose Yourself"" and make 'em lose it
""I don't know how to make songs like that
I don't know what words to use.""
Let me know when it occurs to you
While I'm rippin' any one of these verses that versus you
It's curtains, I'm inadvertently hurtin' you
How many verses I gotta murder to
Prove that if you were half as nice, your songs you could sacrifice virgins too?!
Ugh, school flunky, pill junkie
But look at the accolades these skills brung me
Full of myself, but still hungry
I bully myself 'cause I make me do what I put my mind to
And I'm a million leagues above you
Ill when I speak in tongues, but it's still tongue-in-cheek, fuck you
I'm drunk, so, Satan, take the fucking wheel
I'ma sleep in the front seat
Bumpin' Heavy D and the Boyz, still ""Chunky but Funky""
But in my head there's something I can feel tugging and struggling
Angels fight with devils and here's what they want from me
They're askin' me to eliminate some of the women hate
But if you take into consideration the bitter hatred
I have, then you may be a little patient
And more sympathetic to the situation
And understand the discrimination
But fuck it, life's handin' you lemons? Make lemonade then!
But if I can't batter the women
How the fuck am I supposed to bake 'em a cake then?
Don't mistake him for Satan
It's a fatal mistake if you think I need to be overseas and take a vacation
To trip a broad, and make her fall on her face and
Don't be a retard—be a king? Think not
Why be a king when you can be a god?6.8K"

Hello, I would like to tell you about my love affair with my husband and the wonderful ways that we were able to understand each other, and find out about each other. We got to know each other little by little, living very close in the same building, and he would help me with things, and I would see him and think ""what a cute guy,"" and he was a cute guy. And it was just little by little, we got to know just to say hello. One day, I invited him to a party and I had heard so much about him, people respected him, and he was good to everybody he knew, people he worked with all adored him. And it was something so important. The respect that you have for somebody, for me, was the most important. Being attracted to him and being... finding people respected him and I respected him. I love the fact that he sensed how my feelings were, and I learned to understand and respect and see his feelings and understand his feelings ahead of time. So, it was so very easy to be together and look forward to being together and our love affair just blossomed the more we saw each other. And the more we were together, we learned more and more about each other. After a short period of time, we became engaged and had a very small intimate wedding with just family and very close friends, the friends we continued to have for the rest of our life. And then came two adorable little boys, and my husband just adored my daughter and adored the two boys.

Fulfilled
Listen, even back when we was broke, my team ill
Martin Luther King woulda been on Dreamville, talk to a nigga

No role models, and I'm here right now
No role models to speak of
Searchin' through my memory, my memory, I couldn't find one
Last night, I was gettin' my feet rubbed by the baddest bitch
Not Trina, but I swear to God, this bitch'll make you call your girl up
And tell her, ""Hey, what's good?
Sorry, I'm never comin' home, I'ma stay for good""
Then hang the phone up and proceed to lay the wood
I came fast like 9-1-1 in White neighborhoods
Ain't got no shame 'bout it
She think I'm spoiled and I'm rich 'cause I can have any bitch
I got defensive and said, ""Nah, I was the same without it""
But then I thought back, back to a better me
Before I was a B-list celebrity
'Fore I started callin' bitches ""bitches"" so heavily
Back when you could get a platinum plaque without no melody, you wadn't sweatin' me

A young man stands in his bedroom. It just so happens that today, the 13th of April, 2009, is this young man's birthday. Though it was thirteen years ago he was given life, it is only today he will be given a name!

What will the name of this young man be?

> Enter name.
> Try Again.
> Examine room.

Your name is JOHN. As was previously mentioned it is your BIRTHDAY. A number of CAKES are scattered about your room. You have a variety of INTERESTS. You have a passion for REALLY TERRIBLE MOVIES. You like to program computers but you are NOT VERY GOOD AT IT. You have a fondness for PARANORMAL LORE, and are an aspiring AMATEUR MAGICIAN. You also like to play GAMES sometimes.

What will you do?

> John: Quickly retrieve arms from drawer.

Your ARMS are in your MAGIC CHEST, pooplord!

> Remove CAKE from MAGIC CHEST.

Out of sympathy for John's perceived lack of arms, you pick up the CAKE for him and put it on his BED.

> John: Quickly retrieve arms from MAGIC CHEST.
You retrieve your FAKE ARMS from the chest. You use these for HILARIOUS ANTICS.

You CAPTCHALOGUE them in your SYLLADEX. You have no idea what that actually means though.

There are other items in the chest.

> John: Examine contents of chest.

In here you keep an array of humorous and mystical ARTIFACTS, each one a devastating weapon in the hands of a SKILLED MAGICIAN or a CUNNING PRANKSTER.

You are neither of these things.

Among the ARTIFACTS are: TWO (2) FAKE ARMS , ONE (1) PAIR OF TRICK HANDCUFFS, ONE (1) STUNT SWORD, ONE (1) MAGICIAN'S HAT, ONE (1) PAIR OF BEAGLE PUSS GLASSES, SEVERAL (~) SMOKE PELLETS, SEVERAL (~) BLOOD CAPSULES, and ONE (1) COPY OF COLONEL SASSACRE'S DAUNTING TEXT OF MAGICAL FRIVOLITY AND PRACTICAL JAPERY, and ONE (1) COPY OF HARRY ANDERSON'S ""WISE GUY"", BY MIKE CAVENEY.

Some of this stuff may come in handy at some point. For now, you decide to just take the SMOKE PELLETS.

> John: Captchalogue smoke pellets.

You stow the SMOKE PELLETS on one of your CAPTCHALOGUE CARDS in your SYLLADEX.

You still aren't totally sure what that means, but you are starting to get the hang of the vernacular at least.

You have two empty CAPTCHALOGUE CARDS remaining.

> John: Equip fake arms.
You aren't totally sure if ""EQUIP"" is a verb copasetic with the abstract behavioral medium in which you dwell, but you give it a try anyway.

Unfortunately, you cannot access the FAKE ARMS! Their card is underneath the one you just used to captchalogue the SMOKE PELLETS. You will have to use the pellets first in order to access the arms. But this is probably unadvisable, since you'd just make your room lousy with smoke!

Your SYLLADEX'S FETCH MODUS is currently dictated by the logic of a STACK DATA STRUCTURE. You were never all that great with data structures and you find the concept puzzling and mildly irritating.

But with any hope, perhaps you will advance new, more practical FETCH MODI for your SYLLADEX with a little more experience.

> John: Examine Problem Sleuth Poster.

Is it even possible to get any more hard boiled than that? You really doubt it. This poster was one of your wisest purchases.

There is a nice spot on the wall next to it. You've been meaning to hang another poster there soon.

> John: Read note on drawer.

This note is rich with the aromas of FATHERLY AFTERSHAVES AND COLOGNES.

Beside the note is a ROLLED UP POSTER.

> John: Take poster.

Another BIRTHDAY ARTIFACT. You wonder what is printed on the poster.

You'll need some way to hang it on your wall.
> John: Acquire hammer and nails. They will come in handy.

You first place the HAMMER into your SYLLADEX.

But now all of your CAPTCHALOGUE CARDS are full. You wonder what will happen if you try to take the NAILS?

You guess it doesn't hurt to try.

> John: Take nails.

You captchalogue FOUR (4) NAILS into the top card, and push all the ARTIFACTS down a card.

The FAKE ARMS are pushed entirely out of the deck!!!

Oh well. They're probably completely useless anyway. But you probably don't want to do that again, unless you want to drop the SMOKE PELLETS and suffer the consequences.

In any case, you now feel like you have gathered enough things to get down to business and do some really important stuff. The next thing you do will probably be exceptionally meaningful.

> John: Squawk like an imbecile and shit on your desk.

This is the dumbest idea you've had in weeks!!!

STUPID STUPID STUPID.

And yet the polished surface of your desk...

It beckons.

> John: Combine the nails and hammer.

You MERGE the top two cards.

The HAMMER and NAILS are now captchalogued on the same card and can be used together.

> John: Use hammer/nails on poster.

You use the HAMMER and NAILS card IN CONJUNCTION with the card beneath it.

> John: Nail poster to wall.

You use the HAMMER, NAILS, and POSTER on the blank space on the wall.

It's glorious. Exactly what you wanted. The old man really came through this time.

> John: Examine Con Air poster.

PUT THE BUNNY BACK IN THE BOX.

I SAID, PUT THE BUNNY BACK IN THE BOX.

WHY COULDN'T YOU PUT THE BUNNY BACK IN THE BOX?

> John: Examine Deep Impact poster.

Morgan Freeman's genteel, homespun mannerisms were perfect qualities for a president residing over a crisis.

OCEANS RISE. CITIES FALL. HOPE SURVIVES.

WOW.

Films about impending apocalypse fascinate you. Plus, a black president??? Now you've seen everything!

> John: Examine calendar.

You've marked your birthday, the 13th of April. Another day you marked was supposed to be the arrival date for the highly touted SBURB BETA LAUNCH.

It's been three days already. It's starting to become a sore subject with you.

> John: Eat cake.

You are sick to death of cake!!! You've been eating it all day. And you have no intention of clogging your SYLLADEX with it either. The CAKE stays put for now.

You hear a notice from your COMPUTER. Someone is messaging you.

> John: Examine incoming message.

You pull up to your COMPUTER. This is where you spend most of your time. You decorated your desktop with some rather handsome WALLPAPER which you made yourself. You are really proud of it.

Your desktop is also littered with various PROGRAMMING PROJECT FILES. You are so bad at programming sometimes you wonder why you even bother with it.

Your PESTERCHUM application is flashing. Someone is trying to get in touch with you.

> John: Open Pesterchum.

Only one of your CHUMS is logged in. He's sent you a message.

> John: Open message.

TG: hey so what sort of insane loot did you rake in today
EB: i got a little monsters poster, it's so awesome. i'm going to watch it again today, the applejuice scene was so funny.
TG: oh hell that is such a coincidence i just found an unopened container of apple juice in my closet it is like fucking christmas up in here
EB: ok thats fine, but i just have one question and then a word of caution. have you ever seen a movie called little monsters starring howie mandel and fred savage?
TG: but
TG: the seal on the bottle is unbroken
TG: are you suggesting someone put piss in my apple juice at the factory
EB: all im saying is don't you think monster howie mandel has the power to do something as simple as reseal a bottle?
EB: try using your brain numbnuts.
TG: why did the fat kid or whoever drank it know what piss tasted like
TG: i mean his reaction was nigh instantaneous
EB: it was the 15th day in a row howie mandel peed in his juice.
TG: ok i can accept that
TG: monster B-list celebrity douchebags are cunning and persistent pranksters
TG: also fred savage has a really punchable face
TG: but who cares about this lets stop talking about it
TG: did you get the beta yet
EB: no.
EB: did you?
TG: man i got two copies already
TG: but i dont care im not going to play it or anything the game sounds boring
TG: did you see how it got slammed in game bro????
EB: game bro is a joke and we both know it.
TG: yeah
TG: why dont you go check your mail maybe its there now
EB: alright.

> John: Look out window.

You see the view of your yard from your window.

Hanging from the tree is your TIRE SWING. In a kid's yard, a tree without a tire swing is like a proper gentleman without a monocle. That is to say, HE CAN HARDLY BE CONSIDERED A TERRIBLY PROPER GENTLEMAN AT ALL.

And there beside your driveway is the mailbox.

> John: Examine mailbox.

The little red arm-swingy-dealy thing or whatever it is called is flipped up!

What the hell is that thing called anyway. You do not have time for these semantics. The red flippy-lever thing means you have new mail. And that means the beta might be here!

> John: Go outside and check mailbox.

You are about to hurry down stairs when you hear a car pull into the driveway. It looks like your DAD has returned from the grocery store.

Oh great. He is beating you to the mail.

> John: Forget it. Check mail later.

If you go down stairs to get it, he will likely monopolize hours of your time. You decide to chill out up here for a while until the dust settles.

Sometimes you feel like you are trapped in this room. Stuck, if you will, in a sense which possibly borders on the titular.

And now your chum is pestering you again. The clockwork of friendship turns ceaselessly, operating the swing-lever dealies of harassment in perpetuity!

Whatever. The dude can just hold his damn horses.

> John: Examine games on CD rack.

You've put countless manhours into this assortment of quality titles.

> John: Read COLONEL SASSACRE'S DAUNTING TEXT.

You decide to consult with the Colonel's bottomless wisdom. Good grief this thing is huge. It could kill a cat if you dropped it.

But to really dig into this hefty book, you will have to captchalogue it. You are not sure you are ready to logjam your other ARTIFACTS beneath it just yet.

> John: Captchalogue fake arms again.

What did you just say?? You don't want to clog up your...

Oh, Jesus. In a momentary lapse of concentration, you accidentally captchalogue the arms again.

> John: Set Pesterchum status to ""bully"".

You don't think the situation is quite dire enough to go all the way to ""RANCOROUS"", but you still feel the PESTERCHUM client should reflect your mood change in some way.

""BULLY"" will have to do. You guess.

This unsurprisingly does nothing whatsoever.

Oh, right, you forgot your chum is still pestering you.

> John: Answer chum.

TG: is it there
TG: plz say yes
TG: maybe you can play with TT shes been pestering me all day about it
TG: shes mackin on me so hard all the time i start to feel embarrassed for her
TG: i mean not that i can blame her or anything
EB: yes, it is understandable because you are really attractive. i am attracted to you.
TG: thank you
EB: jk haha.
EB: no, i don't have it yet.
EB: my dad has the mail and i guess i have to go get it from him and see if it's there.
EB: and i've been busy spending all afternoon shitting around with my stupid sylladex.
EB: it's so frustrating.
TG: whats your modus
EB: what?
TG: how do you retrieve artifacts from it
EB: oh. like one at a time i guess. and if i put too much in, something falls out.
TG: stack?? hahahahahaha
EB: what is yours?
TG: hash map
TG: my bro taught me a few tricks he basically knows everything and is awesome
EB: what the hell is that?
TG: you should probably brush up on your data structures
EB: i guess.
TG: did you at least allocate your strife specibus
EB: no.
TG: it could free up a card for you
TG: plus let you attack stuff whenever things get too hot to handle
TG: which is never
TG: what have you got
EB: well, i've got a hammer but it's trapped under some arms.
TG: wow you really suck at this dont you
TG: just get rid of the arms and then allocate the hammer to the specibus
EB: how?
TG: i dont know just use the arms on any old thing and see if it works

> John: Combine fake arms with cake.

You stick the FAKE ARMS in the CAKE on your bed.

This definitely makes the CAKE at least 300% more hilarious. You're sure COLONEL SASSACRE would know the precise index of elevated hilarity.

> John: Allocate hammer to strife specibus.

You check the back of your STRIFE SPECIBUS for the KIND ABSTRATUS you have in mind for it.

> John: Select ""HAMMER"".

Your STRIFE SPECIBUS has been ALLOCATED with the HAMMERKIND ABSTRATUS.

The HAMMER has been moved from your CAPTCHALOGUE DECK to your STRIFE DECK.

> John: Report progress to TG.

EB: ok, i did it.
TG: hammerkind?
EB: yeah.
TG: ok that will be the permanent allocation for your specibus
TG: i guess i should have mentioned that
EB: uh...
TG: hope you like hammers dude!
EB: yeah, that's fine i guess. i can't imagine it's going to be all that relevant.

> John: Captchalogue Colonel's big book.

Now that you've got some space in your SYLLADEX to work with, you figure you might as well start squandering it immediately.

Ordinarily this ridiculous book would be way too heavy to carry around in any practical way. You guess maybe this is one respect in which the cards present some convenience.

> John: Examine GameBro Magazine.
> John: Read article.
> John: Captchalogue GameBro.

It might come in handy if you ever need something that burns easily.

> John: Captchalogue magician's hat.

You expend your final card on the MAGICIAN'S HAT.

> John: Get funny glasses too.

You don't have a free card in your SYLLADEX!

However, you are able to MERGE the BEAGLE PUSS with the MAGICIAN'S HAT to create a CLEVER DISGUISE.

> John: Wear disguise to fool dad.

John? Who is this ""John"" you speak of? You are quite certain there has never been, nor ever will be...

Yeah, this is a really shitty disguise.

While you are wearing the items, they remain on the card, but it is temporarily removed from the deck, thus freeing up the cards beneath it.

> John: Leave room.

You exit into the HALLWAY.

On one wall hangs a picture of a fella who sure knows how to have a laugh, a man after your own heart. You always thought he looked a lot like Michael Cera. But your DAD swears on the many HALLOWED TOMBS of Egypt that it is not. You're not sure about that though.

On the other wall is one of your DAD'S stupid clowns. Or HARLEQUINS, as he is quick to correct anyone who would venture such brazen assumption.

> John: Go downstairs.

The accursed odor of fresh baking wafts into your newfound nostrils. Something is brewing in the KITCHEN. It must be the connivings of your arch nemesis, BETTY CROCKER, and the rich, buttery aroma of her plot stinks to high heaven.

This mission is going to be more difficult than you imagined.

> John: Admire harlequins.

You check out the shelves of FANCIFUL HARLEQUINS.

Look at this fucking garbage. You hate this stuff. Funny is funny, but your DAD sure can be a real cornball.

Sometimes at night you pray for burglars.

> John: Examine fireplace.

A bright orange flame flickers in the FIREPLACE. It doesn't matter that it's April and not terribly chilly outside. In a home, a FIREPLACE needs a fire, because that's what FIREPLACE is for. A fire BELONGS in a FIREPLACE, dammit, cata(ptcha)gorically, at all times, without exception.

As domestic myth of unaccountable origin holds, a home borrows the spirit of the flame for as long as it makes a guest of it, much as the moon takes liberty with the sun's rays.

""The moon's an arrant thief, and her pale fire she snatches from the sun."" -Mark Twain

You are almost certain Mark Twain said that.

> John: Toss GameBro into fire.

It doesn't burn as quickly as you hoped.

Each GAMEBRO MAGAZINE is guaranteed to be printed on 40% recycled asbestos. For big ups to Mother Earth, yo.

> John: Fondly regard cremation.

You examine the SACRED URN containing your departed NANNA'S ASHES.

When your father gives her portrait a wistful glance now and then, you can tell it brings back painful memories. A tall bookshelf. A ladder. An unabridged COLONEL SASSACRE'S.

He never wants to talk about it.

> John: Topple urn.

You clumsily mishandle the SACRED URN. Ash is everywhere.

In retrospect, upon mulling cinematic tropes regarding ash-filled urns, this outcome was a virtual certainty.

You'd probably better clean it up before DAD finds it.

> John: Combine father's pipe with clever disguise.

You think now would be a good time to beef up your CLEVER DISGUISE.

> John: Examine oversized gift.

Contemplating what could be inside this package is sort of exciting, but it makes you a little nervous at the same time.

> John: Open large present.

Oh hell no.

> John: Captchalogue ashes.

First you prop the HARLEQUIN DOLL up on the couch. Having it in the middle of the floor sprawled out all akimbo like that struck you as unseemly.

You captchalogue the ASHES to your available card.

> John: Combine ashes with urn.

You merge the SACRED URN with the ASHES.

Most of the ASH is back in the URN, but it's a total mess. Really it probably would have been tidier if you just used a broom and dustpan.

> John: Put urn back.

No one will be the wiser.

Except maybe for people with eyes.

> John: Go get fake arms again.

You just got another BRILLIANT idea for something to do with those pointless arms. You pry them out of the CAKE and captchalogue them.

Looks like PESTERCHUM is acting up again."

With the windows down an' the radio up
We sit there poppin' tops, shootin' bull an' singin' songs
But you can bet your boots that when Haggard comes on


We tip our hats
And raise our glasses of cold, cold beer
They say country's fading
But we still wavin' that flag around here
And when it's time to go, you know you're welcome back

Cave in a windshield with a baseball bat
In the bed of my truck staring up at the moon
Country night crickets and they're playing our tune
Red light flash and she hits the gas, bloodshot eyes, she's stealing mash
She prays to Jesus but packs a gun, 3 shots to the chest, there's 911
Camo boots and bathing suits, talks with a twang and loves her roots
Southern pride, jacked up ride, she's pissed off y'all better hide
She's hunting ducks in diesel trucks, pistol grip and mounted bucks
Backwoods Barbie, southern belle, angel with a pitchfork raising hell

But I couldn't ask for more
Girl, what we got's worth thanking God for


So thank God I get to wake up by your side
And thank God your hand fits perfectly in mine

A soft blanket holding you tight
And every night sleeping next to someone's
Just as warm as the gaslight


It’s funny how jealousy sounds like
Somebody's worried bout you
And all that control
Takes on different roles
Don't realize the toll it takes on you


I've been to pretty dark places
Stuck in toxic situations
But you taste like stability
And that's new for me


Yeah, this feels like homemade cooking like
Backyard kissing like
Hold the door open and I laugh but it's nice like
Sunday, sleepin' in
Baby, I'm leanin' in
Conversations I can tell that you're listening
I thought I knеw what
I knew what love was
Guess I didn't know at all

But I think love's supposed to feel like this

Playing this old bar again
Young newly wed couple showed up
Spotted them as soon as they walked in
They looked so in love
Young man looked up at me, threw me a five
And asked if he could buy me a drink
He said I wish I could sing and play guitar man you've got it made
I said before we go and toast to that, there's something I gotta say

I'd give it all, I'd give it back, I'd make a call
Wouldn't take me long to pack
And I'd give it up, I'd give it in
If only I, could see her again
Just took this long to see, that this ain't where I need to be
I've had too much fun, I'm headed north on 21

Made a lot of good friends, but lost them just as fast
You can't see the real world, through the bottom of a glass
Ain't even got a dog, cause I'm always on the road
Don't even call home, even a letter wrote
But if I could see the bright lights of Montgomery, Alabam'
Take this long road back up home, and never take it down

I'd give it all, I'd give it back, I'd make a call
Wouldn't take me long to pack
And I'd give it up, I'd give it in
If only I, could see her again
Just took this long to see, that this ain't where I need to be
I've had too much fun, I'm headed north on 21

Shaking that rattle like I always did
Susie strolled in that little girl next door
Next thing you know we were rolling on the floor
Mama came a runnin' to her little pride and joy
Said bless this little heart he's an excitable boy

High school redneck rebel to the bone
Running eighty miles an hour in a thirty mile zone
Steal a little kiss- Skip a little school
Break another heart bend another rule
Cop tells the principal he's only making noise
Cut the kid some slack he's an excitable boy

Chorus:
I've been a renegade
Since the day I was born
I get a little carried away
Never meant to do nobody no harm
I gotta rock it, I can't stop it
I ain't about to change

Parking with my darling fogging up the glass
Slipping 'cross the truck seat trying to make a pass
My baby said stop we gotta take it slow
But you know me I'm always raring to go
It's the way I am I don't have no choice
