Korn,Rotting in Vain,rock,"I wouldn't be angry if you'd just fucking cry
Your tears would arouse me, refreshing my supply
The suffering is fading, I scream into the sky
Repulsion invades me, I say goodbye


Digging deep inside of me
Getting past this agony
I can't seem to get away
Another day rotting in vain


I wouldn't be angry if things would stay the same
You're fighting the torment that helps me feed my pain
The suffering is fading, I scream into the sky
Repulsion invades me, I say goodbye


Digging deep inside of me
Getting past this agony
I can't seem to get away
Another day rotting in...


I can't hear this (scat singing)
I can't fuck it (scat singing)
I can't take this (scat singing)
I hate... (scat singing)

OneRepublic,Christmas Without You,rock,"It's almost midnight, where you lay your head
But I'm calling numbers, buying plane tickets and bed
Every channel on the TV, it's a wonderful life
I don't feel so wonderful on this cold winter night


I missed Thanksgiving, missed a birthday or two
Didn't make St. Valentines, but I was thinking of you
Only one thing in the world that I couldn't do
Only one thing could kill me, Christmas without you


Ooh, the snow is on the ground
The day's getting colder, I'm coming home now
So go ahead light the fire, turn that Christmas tree on
Because I've been missing you so much, that I wrote you this song
Yes, I did


I missed Thanksgiving, missed a birthday or two
Didn't make St. Valentines, but I was thinking of you
Only one thing in the world that I couldn't do
Only one thing could kill me, Christmas without you

Juanes,Vía Láctea,rock,"Llevo tu voz en mi voz
Grabada con aerosol
Tu beso fantasma pegado en mi labio inferior
Y el mapa de tu desnudez


Llevo el prisma de tus ojos
En mi casco de astronauta
Y la tímida aurora de tus células


Y todas las noches bajo la vía láctea
Parecen eternas si tú no estás
Todas las noches desde mi ventana
Conjuro tu nombre inmortal
Oh-oh


A veces llora mi piel
Cuando se empaña de anhelo
Se infla mi mente con tantos recuerdo-os
Que ya no me puedo dormir, oh
Y en la alfombra de tus sueños soy el rayo vagabundo
Y desmaya y dolece, pero no se apaga

Twenty One Pilots,Stressed Out,rock,"I wish I found some better sounds no one's ever heard
I wish I had a better voice that sang some better words
I wish I found some chords in an order that is new
I wish I didn't have to rhyme every time I sang
I was told, when I get older, all my fears would shrink
But now I'm insecure, and I care what people think

We're stressed out (Out, out, out, out)


Sometimes a certain smell will take me back to when I was young
How come I'm never able to identify where it's comin' from?
I'd make a candle out of it, if I ever found it
Try to sell it, never sell out of it, I'd probably only sell one
It'd be to my brother, 'cause we have the same nose
Same clothes, homegrown, a stone's throw from a creek we used to roam
But it would remind us of when nothing really mattered
Out of student loans and treehouse homes, we all would take the latter

And if I had the choice
Yeah, I'd always wanna be there

Solo basta estar aquí
Suficiente con mirarnos

The Rolling Stones,"Paint It, Black",rock,"I see a red door and I want it painted black
No colours anymore, I want them to turn black
I see the girls walk by dressed in their summer clothes
I have to turn my head until my darkness goes


I see a line of cars and they're all painted black
With flowers and my love, both never to come back
I see people turn their heads and quickly look away
Like a newborn baby, it just happens every day


I look inside myself and see my heart is black
I see my red door, I must have it painted black
Maybe then I'll fade away and not have to face the facts
It's not easy facing up when your whole world is black


No more will my green sea go turn a deeper blue
I could not foresee this thing happening to you
If I look hard enough into the setting sun
My love will laugh with me before the morning comes

Christina Perri,A Thousand Years,rock,"Heart beats fast, colors and promises
How to be brave? How can I love when I'm afraid to fall?
But watching you stand alone
All of my doubt suddenly goes away somehow


One step closer


I have died every day waiting for you
Darling, don't be afraid
I have loved you for a thousand years
I'll love you for a thousand more


Time stands still, beauty in all she is
I will be brave, I will not let anything take away
What's standing in front of me
Every breath, every hour has come to this


One step closer


I have died every day waiting for you
Darling, don't be afraid

Didn't make St. Valentines, but I was thinking of you
Only one thing in the world that I couldn't do
Only one thing could kill me, Christmas without you


Ooh, the snow is on the ground
The day's getting colder, I'm coming home now
So go ahead light the fire, turn that Christmas tree on
Because I've been missing you so much, that I wrote you this song
Yes, I did

Was a jolly happy soul
With a corn-cob pipe and a button nose
And two eyes made out of coal
Frosty the snowman
Is a fairy tale they say
He was made of snow
But the children know
How he came to life one day
There must have been some magic
In that old silk hat they found
For when they placed it on his head
He began to dance around
Frosty the snowman
Was alive as he could be
And the children say
He could laugh and play
Just the same as you and me
Frosty the snowman
Knew the sun was hot that day
So he said, ""let's run
And we'll have some fun
Now before i melt away""
Down to the village
With a broomstick in his hand
Running here and there
All around the square
Saying, ""catch me if you can""
He led them down
The streets of town
Right to the traffic cop
And he only paused a moment
When he heard them holler, ""stop!""
Frosty the snowman
Had to hurry on his way
But he waved goodbye
Saying, ""don't you cry
I'll be back again some day""See The Beach Boys LiveGet tickets as low as $35You might also like"

Don't take my advice
You never wanted the nice boys, anyway
And I'm of good cheer
'Cause I've been checking my list
The gifts you're receiving from me will be


One awkward silence
And two hopes you cry yourself to sleep
Staying up, waiting by the phone
And all I want this year's
For you to dedicate your last breath to me
Before you bury yourself alive


Don't come home for Christmas
You're the last thing I wanna see
Underneath the tree
Merry Christmas, I could care less

Don't call me up when the snow comes down

And the last known survivor stalks his prey in the night

A que encuentro las llaves de la felicidad
Anda provócame
Recuérdame que diga no
Al frío, a la pena, diga no al dolor
Empújame y oblígame a dar
Otro paso para caminar
Y permíteme darte la razón
Tu verdad lo arrolla todo es un tren
Ve acércate dame calor

OneRepublic,Christmas Without You,rock,"It's almost midnight, where you lay your head
But I'm calling numbers, buying plane tickets and bed
Every channel on the TV, it's a wonderful life
I don't feel so wonderful on this cold winter night


I missed Thanksgiving, missed a birthday or two
Didn't make St. Valentines, but I was thinking of you
Only one thing in the world that I couldn't do
Only one thing could kill me, Christmas without you


Ooh, the snow is on the ground

Owl City,Fireflies,rock,"You would not believe your eyes if ten million fireflies
Lit up the world as I fell asleep
'Cause they'd fill the open air and leave teardrops everywhere
You'd think me rude but I would just stand and stare


I'd like to make myself believe
That planet Earth turns slowly
It's hard to say that I'd rather stay awake when I'm asleep
'Cause everything is never as it seems


'Cause I'd get a thousand hugs from ten thousand lightning bugs
As they tried to teach me how to dance
A foxtrot above my head, a sock hop beneath my bed
A disco ball is just hanging by a thread


I'd like to make myself believe
That planet Earth turns slowly
It's hard to say that I'd rather stay awake when I'm asleep
'Cause everything is never as it seems (When I fall asleep)


Leave my door open just a crack
(Please take me away from here)
'Cause I feel like such an insomniac
(Please take me away from here)
Why do I tire of counting sheep
(Please take me away from here)
When I'm far too tired to fall asleep?

And we've got nowhere else to go

And songs sung by a choir

So let's stay here by the fire

Mistletoe and a festive tree
There's no place that I'd rather be

And songs sung by a choir
It's freezin' but it's pleasing

I stopped an old man along the way
Hopin' to find some old forgotten words or ancient melodies
He turned to me as if to say
""Hurry, boy, it's waiting there for you""

It's gonna take a lot to drag me away from you
There's nothin' that a hundred men or more could ever do
I bless the rains down in Africa
Gonna take some time to do the things we never had

As they grow restless, longing for some solitary company

Living is tricky as it is so that ain't stopping me

All we want is peace and love and honestly you ruined me
With your beautiful smile and your style continuity
I'd be a fool not to take the opportunity to say
Hey, we should be homies
I think we could be bigger than cheese and macaroni
We could keep it sweet like Chachi and Joanie
Or maybe just be ourselves: Never Phony
Never second guessing the freindship connection
Parallel living, never in possession
Of your individual personal expression
Together we're just a much better reflection of Love

Throwin' out the shade for a little bit of sunshine
Hit me with them good vibes
Pictures on my phone like
Everything is so fine
A little bit of sunshine


A little bit of sunshine
A little bit of sunshine


I don't really know any other way to say this
Can't slow down tryna keep up with the changes
Punch that number in the name when I clock in
And now I feel like Michael with a cane when I walk in
Basically life is the same thing
Unless you don't want the same thing
Probably shoulda went and got a feature, but I didn't
I've been savin' up the money 'cause it's better for the business

Tengo miedo de perderte
Advierto que la razón se puede quebrar de amor
Y desbordar los sentimientos que tanto tiempo tuve dentro
Si te gano, pierdo igual
Si pierdo es porque me entrego, es algo tan natural
Tener el control del juego es algo que no me va
Te dejo la libertad de hacer conmigo lo que quieras
De quererme a tu manera


Y yo soy la hoja que lleva el viento
Que va volando a tu alrededor
Y tú, el aire que me levanta
Que me da fuerza para este amor

Maybe this year will be better than the last
I can't remember the last thing that you said as you were leaving
Now the days go by so fast


And it's one more day up in the canyons
And it's one more night in Hollywood
If you think that I could be forgiven
I wish you would


The smell of hospitals in winter
And the feeling that it's all a lot of oysters, but no pearls
All at once, you look across a crowded room
To see the way that light attaches to a girl


And it's one more day up in the canyons
And it's one more night in Hollywood
If you think you might come to California
I think you should


Drove up to Hillside Manor sometime after 2 A.M
And talked a little while about the year
I guess the winter makes you laugh a little slower
Makes you talk a little lower
About the things you could not show her

blink-182,Ghost On The Dance Floor,rock,"I'll never let you down, boy, I'll never let you go
Her subtle hint of life is so innocent and scary
""So, tell me that you're here, boy,"" she says as if she knows
When God took her with time, God made me quite alone
It's like the universe has left me without a place to go
Without a hint of light to watch the movement glow
When our song was slowly starting, your memory felt so real
At first, against my will, but God invented chills


Yeah I, I saw your ghost tonight, the moment felt so real
If your eyes stay right on mine, my wounds would start to heal


The kids are in a hurry, and I'm just full of fear
The lights make bodies blurry, it's getting hard enough to hear
It's like the evidence is cared for and evidently clear
If I never leave this dance floor, then I'll never leave you here


Yeah I, I saw your ghost tonight, the moment felt so real
If your eyes stay right on mine, my wounds would start to heal
I felt your ghost tonight, and God it felt like hell

Had a band and we tried real hard

That summer seemed to last forever
And if I had the choice
Yeah, I'd always wanna be there
Those were the best days of my life


Ain't no use in complainin'

I spent my evenings down at the drive-in

I'm covered in blue
I'm running and I'm crawling
Fighting for you
When the rain stops, then, darling, what will I do?
And I know I go all in, but why do I?


You give me a reason, something to believe in
I know, I know, I know
You give me a meaning, something I can breathe in
I know, I know, I know
It's a bittersweet feeling
Longing, and I'm leaving
I go, I go, I go
But I wish I was there with you
Oh, I wish I was there with you


There's a crack in my window
A bird in my room
Angels all over that watch over you
When I'm walking on water
All my dreams have come true
Still, nothing means nothing
Without you, you

Jenny handed me a beer
Said, ""How the hell did you get there?""

Sittin' on the dresser
She asked me where they're from
I said, ""A place I don't remember""

You can't blacken the pages with Russian poetry
And be happy""

The thing that washes away the pain

All my sisters come to paint my banisters green
My blue banisters gray
Tex and Mex are in the Bay
Chucky's makin' birthday cake
Chickens runnin' bare feet, there's a baby on the way
And now my blue banisters are green and gray, ah-ah

All of my change I spent on you
Where have the times gone? Baby, it's all wrong
Where are the plans we made for two?


Yeah, I, I know it's hard to remember
The people we used to be
It's even harder to picture
That you're not here next to me
You say it's too late to make it
But is it too late to try?
And in our time that you wasted
All of our bridges burned down


I've wasted my nights
You turned out the lights
Now I'm paralyzed
Still stuck in that time
When we called it ""Love""
But even the sun
Sets in paradise

I'll be out spendin' all this money while you're sittin' 'round
Wondering why it wasn't you who came up from nothin'
Made it from the bottom, now when you see me, I'm stuntin'
And all of my cars start with the push of a button
Telling me I changed since I blew up or whatever you call it
Switched the number to my phone so you never could call it
Don't need my name on my shirt, you can tell that I'm ballin'
Swish, what a shame, coulda got picked
Had a really good game, but you missed your last shot
So you talk about who you see at the top
Or what you could've saw, but sad to say it's over for

Wished I'd go away, got what you was looking for

What would you do in my situation?

What would you do? 'Cause you always do what's right

Oh, darlin', just dive right in and follow my lead
Well, I found a girl, beautiful and sweet
Oh, I never knew you were the someone waitin' for me


'Cause we were just kids when we fell in love
Not knowin' what it was
I will not give you up this time
But, darlin', just kiss me slow
Your heart is all I own
And in your eyes, you're holdin' mine


Baby, I'm dancin' in the dark with you between my arms
Barefoot on the grass while listenin' to our favourite song
When you said you looked a mess, I whispered underneath my breath
But you heard it, ""Darlin', you look perfect tonight""


Well, I found a woman stronger than anyone I know
She shares my dreams, I hope that, someday, I'll share her home
I found a love to carry more than just my secrets
To carry love, to carry children of our own

Woke up this mornin' to somebody in a video
Talkin' about somethin' I posted in a video
If it wasn't me, then would you even get offended or
Is it just because I'm black and heavy? Y'all don't hear me though
I've been the same since I've been drivin' slow on Bissonnet
Call up anybody I knew and they would tell you that
Fame is pretty new, but I've been used to people judgin' me
That's why I move the way I move and why I'm so in love with me


I'm used to feelin' alone, oh
So I thought that I'd let you know


In case nobody told you today
You're special
In case nobody made you believe
You're special
Well, I will always love you the same
You're special
I'm so glad that you're still with us
Broken, but damn, you're still perfect

Could you imagine a world where everybody's the same
And you could cancel a girl 'cause she just wanted to change?
How could you throw fuckin' stones if you ain't been through her pain?
That's why we feel so alone, that's why we feel so much shame, hm


I'm used to feelin' alone, oh
So I thought that I'd let you know (Oh)


In case nobody told you today
You're special
In case nobody made you believe
You're special
Well, I will always love you the same
You're special
I'm so glad that you're still with us
Broken, but damn, you're still perfect (Perfect)


(Ooh) I know that I'm not alone, oh, so
(Ooh) I thought that I'd let you know
Uh, yeah, yeah (No, oh, woo)

In case nobody told you today
You're special (Yeah)
In case nobody made you believe (Oh-oh)
You're special (Yeah)
Well, I will always love you the same (Love you)
You're special
I'm so glad that you're still with us (I'm so glad, so glad, so glad)

In '09, we were still on a bus, nigga
Before Nak was deluxe, when I didn't have a brush
When there still wasn't hoes tryna fuck with me
'Fore I cleaned up a bit like it's company comin'
I ain't know we was on the cusp of the money
Tryna get a few bucks under custody
And my twin brothers was all Syd brothers
So my kin gully and my skin toughened
Thick lens coverin' my eyes now
It ain't bright, nigga, I'm just high now
And if there’s a different way to clear my mind out
I need to find out, I'm doin' fine now
And I don't look as stupid when I talk now
And everybody at the show look astounded
Posted up drowsy
In the cut so much that it's pus 'round me
Catch him in the daytime or dusk hours
Smokin' out the pound, houndin' mutts out it
If your tucks lousy then you can't sit with us (Nah)
Can't call it harsh livin' when the margin between you and all these fuck niggas is about as large as it gets
And you workin', givin' arm and a leg
Say he workin' but he just talkin' 'cause he ain't workin'
Like a long-distance bitch
Who you know that's out that's harder than this?
Chargin' niggas like a Tomlinson win, nigga
Slight frown on the brow on the brim, color brown
Runnin' wild on the route that was picked
When the clouds were enshrouded
I'm out with my face in the shallow end, drownin' again

The most critically acclaimed, slang contortionist
That ain't suckin' corporate dick
Said it with my balls in grip
Other hand got a cork to hit
All this Ralph be the sportsmanship
Walked in and said I needed all the chips
As well as the one on my shoulder
Feel like my heart got pneumonia, blunt laced, covered in odor
Cops still lockin' niggas up for quotas
Brain still numb from the shit in the soda, so
A generation lost
Facin' a Paul Allen in vacant loft
Warrants bein' filed for the cases fought
And them drugs get obtained by debatin' cost
You ain't Superman when that cape is off
Just Clark, nigga, sittin' in his high-rise
Tryna see the bright side of life
And a nigga just keep comin' back with a dark picture
It's like hard liquor, and see people are books
So you judge a ma'fucka by the first page
And a bitch by the back cover
The crime is long-sleeved, so the tats covered
Real ones, I'm the last brother, when they see me on stage
They said my shit was so insane, it was like Cobain did his last number
Motherfucker

I could drown you with a shallow soul
Shallow soul, shallow soul
You are drinkin' from a shallow soul (Yeah)
Shallow soul (Um), shallow soul (Yeah)


Yeah, well
Isn't he dizzy off the ups and downs?
He got a lil' Whitney, put it in a blunt for now (Smoke)
Shit was s'posed to get me high
Why the fuck I wanna die now? (Damn,) and I'm
Strung out on this dusty couch
In a big white ugly house, I tell the bitch, ""Slow down

You holdin' my money, just shut up and count,"" my (Woo) (Count my)
Right nostril hasn't worked in a week
Plus the plug got work, like he servin' for a sheik
Me, I'm swervin' in a Jeep
Burnin' weed, doin' circles in the street (Skrrt,) yellin'
""Play my shit or wake the baby up!"" (Wake up)
I get it faded, put it back in her labia
All my life, I've been afraid of powder
All my life, I've been afraid of power, where did all that go?
The wrong decision always call my phone (Okay)
Last supper I was fuckin' with the Corleones (Uh-huh)
I need somethin' stronger than a cortisone
That can save me from the war I know
Shout out to Soulo (Soul!), and rest in peace Alori Joh
The Devil on the other side of this glory hole (Woah)
Any time, any place, you can bet I'ma eat
'Cause my hand on the fork and the fork in the road (Woah, woah, woah, woah, woah)
Woah, look at all these new faces
I see, I see, I see
They comin' on a plane but they're leavin' their suitcases
Been a criminal before scales were digital
Used to put the weed in the sole of my blue Asics (Woah)
Hate myself, fuck the strangers (Woo)
But the raps are just way too flagrant, so
Here I go (Here I go)
Throwin' up a prayer, it's a Hail Mary
(Woah, where it's at) I've never been religious
But I feel like the scripture's got it all there
It's not just gypsies and fairies (Fairies)
This could be my last breath (Last breath)
I'ma take my time (Wait a second, please)

Coolio;L.V.,Gangsta's Paradise,hip-hop,"To honor the 25th anniversary of Billboard's Hot Rap Songs chart, we’re counting down the tally's top 100 tracks ever

Rap is a victorious genre. Having built its history on songs of overcoming the harshest of hard-knock lives, in addition to observances of all of life's nuances, rap is more than just dope beats and rhymes. Its lyrics tell stories with insights and uncommon honesty, traits that have ultimately taken the genre from niched inner-city beginnings to a longstanding place at the heart of pop culture

So it was fitting for Billboard to create a chart, in 1989, dedicated to the then-rising genre, birthed out of hip-hop. At the time, MTV's influential ""Yo! MTV Raps"" was only a few months old, and acts like Ice-T and N.W.A were not only ruling rap but beginning to enter the mainstream music conversation

While rap has evolved, there’s no denying its ever-growing power. To celebrate the 25th anniversary of the Billboard’s Hot Rap Songs chart, we’re counting down the top 100 songs in the tally’s quarter-century history. From Salt-N-Pepa to Macklemore, we've got the genre's past quarter-century covered

When it comes to rumbling, I'm Afro Thunder
Really it be funny when I kick it to you dummies
How I'm grippin' on the iron when I'm rhyming on the mic
Because it really will get bloody like I'm kicking it with buddies
When I beat a nigga up like I was Iron nigga Mike
I tell 'em they don't wanna tussle, when I'm at 'em, they gon' drop
Bet you that he stumble when I jab him then I cross
Leave a nigga humble like, ""Damn"" when Kenny dropped
'Cause really we can rumble like Jackie in the Bronx
We gon'—

Rumble, they gon' take your face off
They gon' rumble, they gon' take your face off
They gon' rumble, they gon' take yo' face off
They gon' rumble, they gon' take yo' face off (Chyeah)


It's about drive, it's about power, we stay hungry, we devour
Put in the work, put in the hours and take what's ours
Black and Samoan in my veins, my culture bangin' with Strange
I change the game so what's my motherfuckin' name? (Rock)
What they gonna get though?
Desecration, defamation, if you wanna bring it to the masses
Face to face now we escalatin' when I have to put boots to asses
Mean on ya like a dream when I'm rumblin'
You're gonna scream, ""Mama""
So bring drama to the king Brahma (Then what?)
Comin' at ya' with extreme mana (Ahoo, ahoo, ahoo)

Kyu karii, ditch
Thode se paise k liye, tu bani bitch
Malum tha meko, yeh sab paise ka tripp
Yaad hai meko, aaj bhi phele ki kiss
Teri kasam buba, mein karela miss
Aas pe nahi rakha tha, shaddi thi fix
Soch kaise sakti, tu karneka cheat
Yaad kar jara apne, phele k din
Force nahi kara, wo bhi karneki feel


Ek din tera saat bhi, hogaye same scene
Karma pe believe karo, karo jara chill
Kider gaya kya malum, logo ka dil
Heartless kyu banrele, move on ka scene
Ek bhi homies pe, mat kar yakeen
Try kar meku, agar lagra dhating
Kisko nahi bola tha, karna setting
Bore hoti boli, tu karna chating
Malum nai kaise tu, pehenti matching
Baller tha mei, lekin karra bating
Mehfil ke rhyming, tu karra abhi
Pyaara meko kon nai, sirf pyare nabi
Firbhi rakha tumko maine, dil k kareeb
Relation mei aaneka, socha bhi nai
Dil mera tootne se, roka bhi nai
Reham kara tumne mere pe, thoda bhi nai
Pyaar karti tu mujhese, lauda bhi nai
Haat maine kiske samne, joda bhi nai
Bich me se teko mene, choda bhi nai
Trust meko kispe, abhi thoda bhi nai
Sab meko puchrele, sora ki nai
Abhi tak kisko maine, bola bhi nai
Raaz rakha tumko maine, khola bhi nai
Dusri ke saat, mereko hora bhi nai

Call kara maine tumko, aara busy
Dost log bolrele, aai jhavli
Chodh dala accha hua, 12 ki thi
Duaa sirf nikalti, dil se meri
Aaj meko dekhneko, yedi hori
Fake account banake, jhading leri
Leke gaya date pe tumko, mount mary
Best friend dhundti thi, galti meri
Chodh dala maine sab decision, tere pe
Trust kabhi nahi karne wala, wapis tere pe
Akela mei ghumneka, sab muu ko dekhte
Leke tumko ghumneka, mein RX 100 pe
Aise kaise ladki log ko, leke jara date pe
Maan mei sab bolte, koi bolta nai face pe
Rukh jara waisach, kuch lagela dress pe
8 baje ready hoke, aaye tum next day
Baat nai karneke, jyada apun text pe
Kuch nai bola, maine feka usko bed pe
Yede hogayi wo mera, collections dekh k
Khada hua mera, usko saari me dekh k
Conscious mind bola, khayegi teku bech k
Roneka tu, aur wo jaane ki dekh k
Mar jayega tu ek din, aur wo aayegi nai dekhne

You know you count on me, like basketball I'ma be around
I'm on the block, gotta get my chips up, I'll see you late
And you know once I get my chips up, I'll Frito Lay
I'll spend a million and a half so I can free lil' Cool
Bae, let me fuck you in your ass before I let you loose
You can ask all the baddest bitches, I don't spend a dime
I know they with me for my riches, they ain't genuine
If it ain't got nothing to do with my snipers, I'm not involved
You think I got a deal with Chrysler how I stay outta Dodge
I'm snorting these orange strip suboxone's got me nodding off

Remember I was smoking twack joints with the PCP
Back then when I was catching city bus to the BCC
This for the deepest feeling lover that I'm able to express myself

Am I wrong for always tryna help you before I help myself?

Two trailer-park girls go round the outside
Round the outside, round the outside
Two trailer-park girls go round the outside
Round the outside, round the outside
Woo! (Ooh, ooh)


Guess who's back, back again?
Shady's back, tell a friend

I've created a monster
'Cause nobody wants to see Marshall no more, they want Shady, I'm chopped liver
Well, if you want Shady, this is what I'll give ya
A little bit of weed mixed with some hard liquor
Some vodka that'll jump-start my heart quicker
Than a shock when I get shocked at the hospital
By the doctor when I'm not cooperating
When I'm rockin' the table while he's operating (Hey!)
You waited this long, now stop debating
'Cause I'm back, I'm on the rag and ovulating
I know that you got a job, Ms. Cheney
But your husband's heart problem's complicating
So the FCC won't let me be
Or let me be me, so let me see
They tried to shut me down on MTV
But it feels so empty without me
So come on and dip, bum on your lips
Fuck that, cum on your lips and some on your tits
And get ready, 'cause this shit's about to get heavy
I just settled all my lawsuits (Fuck you, Debbie!)
You might also like
Now, this looks like a job for me
So everybody, just follow me
'Cause we need a little controversy
'Cause it feels so empty without me
I said this looks like a job for me
So everybody, just follow me
'Cause we need a little controversy
'Cause it feels so empty without me


Little hellions, kids feeling rebellious
Embarrassed, their parents still listen to Elvis
They start feelin' like prisoners, helpless
'Til someone comes along on a mission and yells, ""Bitch!""
A visionary, vision is scary
Could start a revolution, pollutin' the airwaves
A rebel, so just let me revel and bask
In the fact that I got everyone kissin' my ass
And it's a disaster, such a catastrophe
For you to see so damn much of my ass, you asked for me?
Well, I'm back, da-na-na-na, na-na-na-na-na-na
Fix your bent antenna, tune it in, and then I'm gonna
Enter in and up under your skin like a splinter
The center of attention, back for the winter
I'm interesting, the best thing since wrestling
Infesting in your kid's ears and nesting
Testing, ""Attention, please""
Feel the tension soon as someone mentions me
Here's my ten cents, my two cents is free
A nuisance, who sent? You sent for me?

Now, this looks like a job for me
So everybody, just follow me
'Cause we need a little controversy
'Cause it feels so empty without me
I said this looks like a job for me
So everybody, just follow me
'Cause we need a little controversy
'Cause it feels so empty without me


A tisket, a tasket, I'll go tit-for-tat wit'
Anybody who's talkin', ""This shit, that shit""
Chris Kirkpatrick, you can get your ass kicked
Worse than them little Limp Bizkit bastards
And Moby? You can get stomped by Obie
You thirty-six-year-old bald-headed fag, blow me
You don't know me, you're too old, let go
It's over, nobody listens to techno
Now, let's go, just give me the signal
I'll be there with a whole list full of new insults
I've been dope, suspenseful with a pencil
Ever since Prince turned himself into a symbol
But, sometimes, the shit just seems
Everybody only wants to discuss me
So this must mean I'm disgusting
But it's just me, I'm just obscene (Yeah)
Though I'm not the first king of controversy
I am the worst thing since Elvis Presley
To do Black music so selfishly
And use it to get myself wealthy (Hey!)
There's a concept that works
Twenty million other white rappers emerge
But no matter how many fish in the sea
It'd be so empty without me

Now, this looks like a job for me
So everybody, just follow me
'Cause we need a little controversy
'Cause it feels so empty without me
I said this looks like a job for me
So everybody, just follow me
'Cause we need a little controversy
'Cause it feels so empty without me

Then I can explain it to my heart
Do you accept the plant of my heart or not?
Or should I plant it in someone else's garden?


It's difficult to accept this
I just wanted to talk to you
I would've taken care of everything
All you had to do was say yes
All my dreams are broken
You broke my heart


You're so beautiful
I'll tell you that next time I see you
You're so beautiful
I'll tell you that next time I see you


I could see your city from the mountains
It was a lovely afternoon
The sun was bright orange
But your colours were causing chaos
If I could hold your hand
I would feel overjoyed

And counted the waves with you
Under a roof of stars
We could've had a deep conversation
I bought some expensive wine
We could've filled up our cups


You're so beautiful
I'll tell you that next time I see you
You're so beautiful
I'll tell you that next time I see you
You're so beautiful
I'll tell you that next time I see you


I opened up my heart to you
I only ever told you the truth
I've never seen a girl as beautiful as you
Now where do I go from here?
Be careful, please don't fill my eyes
With tears yet again

You're so beautiful

You're so beautiful
I'll tell you that next time I see you

Sabes que este viaje regresa de día

Solo la luna sabrá el secreto entre tu y yo
Ni yo tampoco amor

Put a rock on your finger and he vowed you a second chance
Built a house right by the coast
That ocean view is beautiful, but baby, I just want you to know
He don't know you like I did
Money talks, but I ain't buyin'


'Cause love's a smoke ring wrapped around your finger
One second, it's a blessin', and the next, it's already gone
A broken heart, I'm a walkin' testimony

You were lyin' when you said that you were tryin' to work things out
But now I'm broken down


Went to battle for you always
Fought for you on your worst days
Then you told me that you don't love me no more


You're the last thing that I thought I'd lose
All I ever wanted was to be loved by you
I let you back in and I gave you a second chance
And like a jet plane on a clear blue sky
Sun came shinin' down on all your lies

Gabby Barrett,The First Noel,country,"The First Noel, the Angels did say
Was to certain poor shepherds in fields as they lay
In fields where they lay keeping their sheep
On a cold winter's night that was so deep

Noel, Noel, Noel, Noel
Born is the King of Israel!

They looked up and saw a star
Shining in the East beyond them far
And to the earth it gave great light
And so it continued both day and night

Noel, Noel, Noel, Noel
Born is the King of Israel!

Then let us all with one accord
Sing praises to our heavenly Lord
That have made heaven and earth of naught
And with His blood mankind hath bought

I recall last Sunday morning a choir from 'cross the street
Came to sing a few old gospel songs
And I heard him tell the singers 'There's a song my mama sang

Shouted for a drink over a screaming guitar

Ingrid Andress,Feel Like This,country,"It's crazy how manipulation feels like
A soft blanket holding you tight
And every night sleeping next to someone's
Just as warm as the gaslight


It’s funny how jealousy sounds like
Somebody's worried bout you
And all that control
Takes on different roles
Don't realize the toll it takes on you


I've been to pretty dark places
Stuck in toxic situations
But you taste like stability
And that's new for me


Yeah, this feels like homemade cooking like
Backyard kissing like
Hold the door open and I laugh but it's nice like

Just lost in the sky wondering why
Everyone else shines out but me

You make me better than I was before

Wandering the city street
Another face in the crowd
Head looking down
Lost in the sound of a lonely melody
Empty pockets at a roulette
Always landing on a lost bet
Just live for the spin and hope for the win
Go all in just to lose again

Upchurch,Traveler,country,"I stay walkin' the woods, gettin' lost in my thoughts
Wonderin' if this path is the one that I'm 'posed to be on
But I do get lost in a daze, way deep back off in my mind
And I realize camera flashes really will make you go blind
And not just blind in a sense and not the cents that make dollars
I'm not gonna go crazy over shit to me that don't really matter
Who cares if you got money, shit, dog, I got money too
But when you drop the materialistic shit then who the fuck are you?
And I'm just strollin' through fields, call me the phantom of Dixie
With the devil creepin' behind, always slick, tryin' to come trick me
But I ain't payin' attention to the shadows that lurk my back
I'm here to be a star and have folks down the road read out my path


He was a traveler, a rockstar, and a healer
Four wheels spinin' in the sunset through the night
Into the dark unknown, guns are loaded
But he always made it home before the light


I grew up with my Paw Paw watchin' reruns of Lonesome Dove
Tombstone and Mash, I'd dress up in his cowboy hat some
And I grab his guitar and pretend to be Johnny Cash on a stage
Just standin' in the kitchen when I didn't know how to play
And I'm surrounded by snakes but I'm the one with the venom
I got the voice of the good people, mainstream won't even listen
I can't even get two seconds, shit, I'm the black sheep I guess
But I'm gonna conquer these obstacles with the blade at my neck
Yeah, I stress out so I smoke and Mary Jane picks me up
My mind-state in the moonlight is somethin' powerful from above
So when the full moon cast a beam and the beam is shinin' on me
I guess it's time to hit the stage like the animal I am

Sunglasses on, baby

A little voice inside my head said
“Don't look back, you can never look back”
I thought I knew what love was, what did I know?
Those days are gone forever
I should just let them go but...


I can see you
Your brown skin shining in the sun
You got the top pulled down and the

Gabby Barrett,The First Noel,country,"The First Noel, the Angels did say
Was to certain poor shepherds in fields as they lay
In fields where they lay keeping their sheep
On a cold winter's night that was so deep

Noel, Noel, Noel, Noel
Born is the King of Israel!

They looked up and saw a star
Shining in the East beyond them far
And to the earth it gave great light
And so it continued both day and night

Noel, Noel, Noel, Noel
Born is the King of Israel!

Then let us all with one accord
Sing praises to our heavenly Lord
That have made heaven and earth of naught
And with His blood mankind hath bought

Maybe she'd fall for a boy from South Georgia
She's got the bar in the palm of her hand
And she's a '90s country fan like I am
Hey, I got a Chevy, she can flip a quarter
I'd drive her anywhere from here to California
When this song is over, I gotta find her
'Cause she had me at ""Heads Carolina""


Yeah, I bought her a round and we talked 'til the lights came on
I still see that girl every time I hear that song

Kenny Rogers,I'll Be Home for Christmas,country,"I'll be home for Christmas
You can plan on me
Please have snow and mistletoe
And presents on the tree

Christmas Eve will find me
Where the lovelight gleams
I'll be home for Christmas
If only in my dreams

I'll be home for Christmas
You can plan on me

Brett Eldredge,Wanna Be That Song,country,"The radio and a sundress
Making my world all a mess
Back corner of a cornfield
Bottle tops and the truth spilled
Pull the lever, lay the seat back laughin'
You slippin' off your shoes
While the dashboard speakers sing every word of ""Night Moves""


I wanna be that song that gets you high
Makes you dance, makes you fall
That melody rewinds years
Once disappear, makes time stall
Wanna be those words that fill you up
Pull your windows down and keeps you young
Makes you believe you're right where you belong
I wanna be that song
I wanna be, wanna be, wanna be, wanna be that song
Oh, I wanna be, I wanna, I wanna


I wanna stand with you in the third row
Window booth at a bar
Back pew on a Sunday pourin' out your heart
(pourin' out your heart)
When the bleachers are crowded
When you're sittin' all alone
When the rain is pourin' and you need something to take you home

I wanna be that song
I wanna be, wanna be, wanna be, wanna be that song
Oh, I wanna be, I wanna, I wanna


When you're searching the horizon (searching the horizon)
When your eyes look back
When you're standing in the moment
Every life has a soundtrack


Oh I wanna be, I wanna be, oh I wanna be
I wanna be that song that gets you high
Makes you dance, makes you fall
That melody rewinds years
Once disappear, makes time stall
Wanna be those words that fill you up
Pull your windows down and keeps you young
Makes you believe you're right where you belong
I wanna be that song

When the highway's calling
When the bottle's dry
When the sky is falling and you're asking yourself why
Oh, oh, I wanna be,(wanna be,wanna be) yeah, oh"
Cody Johnson,Holes,country,"There's a picture frame hangin' at the end of the hall
Pile of dust on the floor where my fist met the drywall
That's my MO, leavin' somethin' broke everywhere I go
Holes


There's a rusty old truck door sittin' in a field
That I filled full of buckshot every time I got
Mad at something over nothin' didn't matter at all


Holes
In my life
Down in my bones
From my heart
To my soul


There's a lonely space on a big brass bed
Where we first made love
And she'd lay her head on my shoulder
Before I told her it was over
Holes


There's a million conversations with my old man
'Bout who he was, and who I am
That I never had, I just wouldn't listen
I just kept digging myself down in 'em

Well I woke up today, put the shovel down
Stepped out of my haze, took a look around
Saw a ray of light shinin' through the clouds
So I climbed out
And I let it shine


Down in my bones
From my heart
Right through my soul
Through all my holes
Through all these holes"
Kenny Chesney,Everyone She Knows,country,"Everyone she knows is getting married
All the girls who used to get around
Cut their hair up to their shoulders
Spend all their Sundays sober now
And everyone she knows is having babies
They got tired of fighting with the clock
And her mama's always asking
If she's ever gonna have one


She's bored with all the boys
And the men are too damn old
She's sick of summer love
But the winter's just too cold
She's a Marilyn in blue jeans
With a touch of Jackie O
She's stuck between seventeen
And everyone she knows
Everyone she knows


Everyone she knows is buying houses
Even though their husbands don't come home
Don't call their exes up to fix it
If they do, they don't admit it, no, no, no
Everyone she knows is getting healthy
She still smokes a couple when she drinks
But the bars are getting harder
They don't ever card her

Bailey Zimmerman,Where It Ends,country,"This is where it ends
I been down a few broken roads that I'm tryin' to mend
But this is where it ends
And I'm breakin' down
You were lyin' when you said that you were tryin' to work things out
But now I'm broken down


Went to battle for you always
Fought for you on your worst days
Then you told me that you don't love me no more


You're the last thing that I thought I'd lose
All I ever wanted was to be loved by you
I let you back in and I gave you a second chance
And like a jet plane on a clear blue sky
Sun came shinin' down on all your lies
I got too much pridе to let that happen again
So this is wherе it ends


Had to bury all your memories
Couldn't see what everybody sees
Red flags said I shoulda walked out that door

Your memory gets to burnin', lean back on the bourbon
Sure as hell can't keep leanin' on you


Looks like I'm learnin' the hard way again
It's all my fault, yeah, I dropped the ball
You're gone and I'm gone three sheets to the wind
Thinkin' 'bout all


I've wasted on you
All of this time and all of this money
All of the these sorries I don't owe you honey
All of these miles on this Chevy, and prayers in a pew
All them days I spent wasted on you
Wasted on you


Yeah, I swore this one'd be different, my heart wouldn't listen
To my head and these boots on my feet
Looks like I'm learnin' the hard way again
That's why I've been

Ingrid Andress,Christmas Always Finds Me,country,"Through the years I've moved a lot
Different doors with different locks
But somehow Christmas always finds me
It's been a while since I wished
For all the blades and pixie sticks
But somehow Christmas always finds me

When silver bells and silent night
And mistletoe's nowhere in sight
With no chance of snow falling down
Another year older
Little harder to believe
But somehow Christmas always finds me

In traffic jams and shopping malls
I lose the magic of it all
But somehow Christmas always finds me

When silvеr bells and silent night
And mistletoе's nowhere in sight
With no chance of snow falling down
Another year older
Little harder to believe
But somehow Christmas always finds me

It takes me back to younger days
Of stockings on the fireplace
And presents stacked
And waiting by the tree
And even if I'm all alone
A million miles away from home
It shows up in warm memory

Getting harder to believe
But somehow Christmas always finds me"
