he told me\\nI\\'ve been looking door to door\\nTo see if there was someone who\\'d hold me\\nNever met a single one who didn\\'t see through me\\nNone of them would love me if they thought they might lose me\\nUnless I made a change\\n\\n[Verse 3]\\nSee I ain\\'t getting better\\nI am only getting behind\\nStanding on the crossroad\\nTrying to make up my mind\\nTrying to remember how it got so
