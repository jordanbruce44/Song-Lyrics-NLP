3 Doors Down,Kryptonite,rock,"Well, I took a walk around the world to ease my troubled mind
I left my body lying somewhere in the sands of time
But I watched the world float to the dark side of the moon
I feel there's nothing I can do, yeah


I watched the world float to the dark side of the moon
After all, I knew it had to be something to do with you
I really don't mind what happens now and then
As long as you'll be my friend at the end


If I go crazy then will you still call me Superman?
If I'm alive and well, will you be there a holding my hand?
I'll keep you by my side with my superhuman might
Kryptonite


You called me strong, you called me weak
But still, your secrets I will keep
You took for granted all the times I never let you down
You stumbled in and bumped your head
If not for me, then you'd be dead
I picked you up and put you back on solid ground

Hell, it's been a very long time

A little old-fashioned but that's all right

The all day rock and roll shows
Them homesick blues and radical views
Haven't left a mark on you

You wear it well
A little out of time but I don't mind


But I ain't forgetting that you were once mine
But I blew it without even tryin'
Now I'm eatin' my heart out
Tryin' to get a letter through


Since you've been gone it's hard to carry on
I'm gonna write about the birthday gown that I bought in town
When you sat down and cried on the stairs
You knew it didn't cost the earth, but for what it's worth
You made me feel a millionaire


And you wear it well
Madame Onassis got nothing on you, no, no


Anyway, my coffee's cold and I'm getting told
That I gotta get back to work
So when the sun goes low and you're home all alone
Think of me and try not to laugh

And I wear it well
I don't object if you call collect


'Cause I ain't forgetting that you were once mine
But I blew it without even tryin'

Between the lines of fear and blame

Where did I go wrong? I lost a friend
Somewhere along in the bitterness
And I would have stayed up with you all night
Had I known how to save a life


Let him know that you know best
'Cause after all, you do know best

Without granting innocence

The things you've told him all along

James Blunt,Postcards,rock,"Sundays sitting on your back porch
And I came on with a couple of chords
And I played for you
You let me keep you entertained
With stories I exaggerate
That you know aren't true
And as you sit there making daisy chains
And I throw in a hand grenade
And tell you how it is I really feel for you


I'm sending postcards from my heart
Your love for a postmark and then
You know that you make me feel like
We've been caught like kids in the schoolyard again
And I can't keep it to myself
Can't spell it any better
L.O.V.E forever
I hope you know that
I'm sending a postcard
I don't care who sees what I've said
Or if the whole world knows what's in my head


We chased the sun til it got away
On a bicycle that your daddy made
But not made for two
Then we sat out on your rocking chair
You with a flower in your hair
That I found for you
But then Monday always comes around
And it's sad cause I can't see you now
Want you to know you're always in my head

You're so cruel, but revenge is a dish best served cold

Searching for the sunshine
Looking for a good time
Following the good vibes
Listening to intuition as it's happening
Diggin' into life cuz at times it can be saddening
Yea it can be a grey day, if you're lonely
A little rain suddenly turns heavy
But a whole lotta love can make the clouds go away
Maybe the time for us is now

Unlonely ain't a word but I don't give a FRUCK
Cause I'm fresh from the farm where critics can't bother me
Living is tricky as it is so that ain't stopping me
You and me we both agree that no one needs the scrutiny
All we want is peace and love and honestly you ruined me
With your beautiful smile and your style continuity
I'd be a fool not to take the opportunity to say
Hey, we should be homies
I think we could be bigger than cheese and macaroni
We could keep it sweet like Chachi and Joanie
Or maybe just be ourselves: Never Phony
Never second guessing the freindship connection
Parallel living, never in possession
Of your individual personal expression
Together we're just a much better reflection of Love

Kodaline,All I Want,rock,"All I want is nothing more
To hear you knocking at my door
'Cause if I could see your face once more
I could die a happy man, I'm sure
When you said your last goodbye
I died a little bit inside
I lay in tears in bed all night
Alone without you by my side


But if you loved me, why'd you leave me?
Take my body, take my body
All I want is and all I need is
To find somebody, I'll find somebody
Like you, oh, oh, oh
Like you, like you


So you brought out the best of me
A part of me I'd never seen
You took my soul and wiped it clean
Our love was made for movie screens


But if you loved me, why'd you leave me?
Take my body, take my body
All I want is, and all I need is
To find somebody, I'll find somebody

MGMT,Little Dark Age,rock,"Breathing in the dark, lying on its side
The ruins of the day painted with a scar
And the more I straighten out, the less it wants to try
The feelings start to rot one wink at a time


Oh-oh
Forgiving who you are for what you stand to gain
Just know that if you hide, it doesn't go away
When you get out of bed, don't end up stranded
Horrified with each stone
On the stage, my little dark age


Picking through the cards, knowing what's nearby
The carvings on the fetish say they find it hard
And the engine's failed again, all limits of disguise
The humor's not the same, coming from denial


Oh-oh
I grieve in stereo, the stereo sounds strange
I know that if you hide, it doesn't go away
If you get out of bed and find me standing
All alone, open-eyed
Burn the page, my little dark age

On the stage, my little dark age


Giddy with delight, seeing what's to come
The image of the dead, dead ends in my mind


Policemen swear to God, love's seeping from the guns
I know my friends and I would probably turn and run
If you get out of bed, come find us heading
For the bridge, bring a stone
All the rage, my little dark age


I grieve in stereo, the stereo sounds strange
I know that if you hide, it doesn't go away
If you get out of bed and find me standing
All alone, open-eyed
Burn the page, my little dark age

Kate Bush,The Man with the Child in His Eyes,rock,"I hear him before I go to sleep
And focus on the day that's been
I realize he's there when I turn the light off
And turn over
Nobody knows about my man
They think he's lost on some horizon


And suddenly I find myself
Listening to a man I've never known before
Telling me about the sea
All his love, till eternity


Ooh, he's here again
The man with the child in his eyes
Ooh, he's here again
The man with the child in his eyes


He's very understanding
He's so aware of all my situations
And when I stay up late he's always waiting
But I feel him hesitate

INXS,Don't Lose Your Head,rock,"Shot your mouth off like a kid

You're loosing grip of what really matters
Cause you don't know where to start
You wake up in the morning
With a starfuck for a friend
The things you do are so in tune
With what you said you hate
What's giving you the will to live
Is looking for revenge
The only laugh that you've got left
Is hiding from the pain
What must have happened to your soul
Is skinnin' you alive
The thing that you fear the most is love
And that's buried deep inside
So deep inside

Don't lose your head
Cause I can't do the time
Don't lose your head
If you can't pay the price

The heart you're building out of rock
Is turning into sand
Cause you never took the time to think
What it means to be a man
You act like you got the answers
When the questions never asked
I've been to where you're coming from
But the postcards weren't so bad
The knife I carry's been sharpened
On the mouth's that won't keep shut
I'll stab at you in the darkness
Cause I'm trying to shed some light

And we felt a little guilty
About spending that whole sunny day inside

About Bonnie and Clyde
They were driving down a backroad
They thought they were home free
The police knew they were coming
They were hiding in the trees
And they shot them down
One hundred and thirty rounds
They shot them down

Phillip Phillips,"Gone, Gone, Gone",rock,"When life leaves you high and dry
I'll be at your door tonight
If you need help, if you need help
I'll shut down the city lights
I'll lie, cheat, I'll beg and bribe

When enemies are at your door
I'll carry you away from war
If you need help, if you need help
Your hope dangling by a string
I'll share in your suffering
To make you well, to make you well


Give me reasons to believe
That you would do the same for me

A frantic beating in my chest
A panicked reeling in my brain
Perspective lost but nothing gained


I was so stuck inside my shell
Then the ground began to sway
I realized what mattered most to me


When the stars began to fall right out of the sky
And the seas were rising up I had one thing in mind
It was you, it was you, it was you
It was you, it was you, it was you
When the road began to crumble in front of my eyes
There was only one person I wanted to find
It was you, it was you, it was you

The Killers,Joy Ride - Night Version,rock,"It's getting close to sundown over the Sierra
Stranded on the heatwave burning with desire
She was on the sidewalk looking for a night light
We talked about the real things
And drove into the fire
Headlights on the highway
The desert wind is howling
Rattlesnakes and romance
Is spilling with the rain
Candy apple red dress
Bleeding when she kissed me
Heaven in a ragtop
Take away my pain
When your chips are down
When your highs are low
Joyride
Move across the night
Like a seperate wind
Pulled up to a motel
""Vacancy"" was buzzing
Pink and dirty neon
Settle on the hood
Wrapped her arms around me
Come a little closer
Stumble in the twilight
And fell onto the floor
Loving Mona Lisa
Dreaming of the free world
Lipstick on the nightstand
And demons at the door
When your chips are down
When your highs are low
Joyride
Move across the night
Like a separate wind
When your hopes and dreams
Lose the will to go
Joyride
Reaching for the light
Knowing we can't win
There's something in the distance
A glorious existance
A simple celebration
A place you've never been before
(Won't you kiss me)
Tell me that you want it more
Reaching for the light
Knowing we can't win
When your chips are down
When your chips are down
When your highs are low
Joyride
All your hopes and dreams
All you need to know

Even harder to write when you know that tonight

Survivor,Eye of the Tiger,rock,"Risin' up, back on the street
Did my time, took my chances
Went the distance, now I'm back on my feet
Just a man and his will to survive
So many times it happens too fast
You trade your passion for glory
Don't lose your grip on the dreams of the past
You must fight just to keep them alive


It's the eye of the tiger, it's the thrill of the fight
Risin' up to the challenge of our rival
And the last known survivor stalks his prey in the night
And he's watching us all with the eye of the tiger


Face to face, out in the heat
Hangin' tough, stayin' hungry
They stack the odds till we take to the street
For the kill with the skill to survive

You can't be everything you wanna be before your time
Although it's so romantic on the borderline tonight, tonight

You know you can't always see when you're right

Open mind for a different view
And nothing else matters


Never cared for what they say
Never cared for games they play
Never cared for what they do
Never cared for what they know
And I know, yeah, yeah





So close, no matter how far
Couldn't be much more from the heart
Forever trusting who we are
No, nothing else matters"
Lenny Kravitz,I Belong To You,rock,"You are the flame in my heart
You light my way in the dark
You are the ultimate star
You pick me up from above
Your unconditional love
Takes me to paradise


I belong to you
And you
You belong to me too
You make my life complete
You make me feel so sweet


You make me feel so divine
Your soul and mind are entwined
Before you, I was blind
But since I've opened my eyes
And with you, there's no disguise
So I could open up my mind
I always loved you from the start
But I could not figure out
That I had to do it every day
So I put away the fight
Now I'm gonna live my life
Giving you the most in every way

You and I were so close in every way
Don't time fly when you're loving and laughing
I've said goodbye so many times
The situation ain't all that new
Optimism's my best defense
I'll get through without you


When I give my heart again
I know it's gonna last forever
No one tell me where or when
I know it's gonna last forever
I won't be that dumb again
I know it's gotta last forever
When I fall in love again
I know it's gonna last forever

Go your own way don't think twice about me
'Cause I've got ideas and plans of my own
So long darlin' I'll miss you believe me

But I know that I'll survive
I'm gonna take a good look at myself and cry

It's no harsher than the bark
The middle of adventure
Such a perfect place to start

(Is what comes from the soul, is what comes from the soul)
And you may call it house 'cause it's not a serious production
Or has to be planned
It's just how you feel
When you wanna say something you just say it

Like if you wanna say 'freedom, I do believe in freedom
Freedom', yeah, something like that

Join hands
House music

What is house music?
A unique form of music that gives complete freedom of expression
It's not with a continual form of something that you do continually
But it's just something that, it's real simple
And it just deals with, anybody can understand it

Like if you wanna say 'freedom, I do believe in freedom
Freedom', yeah, something like that

But you heard it, ""Darlin', you look perfect tonight""


Well, I found a woman stronger than anyone I know
She shares my dreams, I hope that, someday, I'll share her home
I found a love to carry more than just my secrets
To carry love, to carry children of our own

An angel in person and she looks perfect

I had to grow up and accept responsibility, yeah

Lewis Capaldi,Someone You Loved,pop,"I'm going under, and this time, I fear there's no one to save me
This all or nothing really got a way of driving me crazy
I need somebody to hear,  somebody to know
Somebody to have, somebody to hold
It's easy to say, but it's never the same
I guess I kinda liked the way you numbed all the pain


Now, the day bleeds into nightfall
And you're not here to get me through it all
I let my guard down and then you pulled the rug
I was getting kinda used to being someone you loved


I'm going under, and this time, I fear there's no one to turn to
This all or nothing way of loving got me sleeping without you
Now, I need somebody to know, somebody to hear
Somebody to have, just to know how it feels
It's easy to say, but it's never the same
I guess I kinda like the way you help me escape


Now, the day bleeds into nightfall
And you're not here to get me through it all
I let my guard down and then you pulled the rug

I was getting kinda used to being someone you loved
But now the day bleeds into nightfall

Or do you skip my avenue?

Was I even on your way?
I knew when I asked you to (When I asked you to)
Be cool about what I was tellin' you
You'd do the opposite of what you said you'd do (What you said you'd do)

The little ones will grow and I'll still drink your favourite wine
And soon, they're going to close, but I'll see you another day
So much has changed since you've been away


I wish that Heaven had visiting hours
So I could just swing by and ask your advice
What would you do in my situation?
I haven't a clue how I'd even raise them
What would you do? 'Cause you always do what's right


Can we just talk a while until my worries disappear?
I'd tell you that I'm scared of turnin' out a failure
You'd say, ""Remember that the answer's in the love that we create""
So much has changed since you've been away


I wish that Heaven had visiting hours
And I would ask them if I could take you home
But I know what they'd say, that it's for the best

Olivia Rodrigo,happier,pop,"We broke up a month ago
Your friends are mine, you know I know
You've moved on, found someone new
One more girl who brings out the better in you
And I thought my heart was detached
From all the sunlight of our past
But she's so sweet, she's so pretty
Does she mean you forgot about me?


Oh, I hope you're happy
But not like how you were with me
I'm selfish, I know, I can't let you go
So find someone great, but don't find no one better
I hope you're happy, but don't be happier


And do you tell her she's the most beautiful girl you've ever seen?
An eternal love bullshit you know you'll never mean
Remember when I believed
You meant it when you said it first to me?
And now I'm pickin' her apart
Like cuttin' her down will make you miss my wretched heart
But she's beautiful, she looks kind
She probably gives you butterflies

And hearts that would give you a diamond ring
When I fold, you see the best in me

I was upside down from the outside in
You came to the table and you went all in
With a single word and a gentle touch
You turned a moment into forever

See you make your way through the crowd

Little did I know


That you were Romeo, you were throwing pebbles
And my daddy said, ""Stay away from Juliet""
And I was crying on the staircase
Begging you, ""Please don't go,"" and I said


Romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone
I'll be waiting, all there's left to do is run
You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess

Conan Gray,Heather,pop,"I still remember, third of December
Me in your sweater, you said it looked better
On me than it did you, only if you knew
How much I liked you, but I watch your eyes as she


Walks by
What a sight for sore eyes
Brighter than a blue sky
She's got you mesmerized while I die


Why would you ever kiss me?
I'm not even half as pretty
You gave her your sweater, it's just polyester
But you like her better, wish I were Heather

Watch as she stands with her holding your hand
Put your arm 'round her shoulder, now I'm getting colder
But how could I hate her? She's such an angel
But then again, kinda wish she were dead as she


Walks by
What a sight for sore eyes
Brighter than a blue sky
She's got you mesmerized while I die

Man, I got a song for y'all
Interesting
Actual writing
Something y'all ain't ever heard of


Well, she wants a cowboy
So I just might
Find me some boots
That fit me right
Chew some tobacco
Ride me a Bronco
On a southern Saturday night


I ain't never rode a horse
Or worn a cowboy hat
But I'll find me one that fits my head
And she won't know any of that
I keep walking this town
Tryna get me some advice
But all the ranch hands around
Keep on sayin' they wanna fight
And I learned to two step, so I can spin her
Off her pretty little country feet
If she wants a cowboy
Then I'll be as cowboy
As a cowboy can be

She wanted a cowboy, so I went off
And rode me a horse about every day
Got pretty good at ranching and riding
But she, didn't care anyway
Champion buckles, and champion spurs

What the hell was all this worth


Find me a horse that I can cover
Find me some stars to sleep under
Find me a train, I'll hop out west

And in the shadows of downtown I hung around
To find me a gold buckle queen

Her looming shadow grows
Hidden in the branches
Of the poison creosote
She twines her spines up slowly
Towards the boiling sun
And when I touched her skin
My fingers ran with blood

In the hushing dusk, under a swollen silver moon
I came walking with the wind to watch the cactus bloom
A strange hunger haunted me, the looming shadows danced
I fell down to the thorny brush and felt a trembling hand


When the last light warms the rocks
And the rattlesnakes unfold
Mountain cats will come to drag away your bones


Then rise with me forever
Across the silent sands
And the stars will be your eyes
And the wind will be my handsYou might also like"

When he was out of sight they snuck around inside
And found a door leading under the ground
They popped a lock on the latch
Walked down and flashed their lights and guess what they found
A cellar full of holy water

A young man stands in his bedroom. It just so happens that today, the 13th of April, 2009, is this young man's birthday. Though it was thirteen years ago he was given life, it is only today he will be given a name!

What will the name of this young man be?

> Enter name.
> Try Again.
> Examine room.

Your name is JOHN. As was previously mentioned it is your BIRTHDAY. A number of CAKES are scattered about your room. You have a variety of INTERESTS. You have a passion for REALLY TERRIBLE MOVIES. You like to program computers but you are NOT VERY GOOD AT IT. You have a fondness for PARANORMAL LORE, and are an aspiring AMATEUR MAGICIAN. You also like to play GAMES sometimes.

What will you do?

> John: Quickly retrieve arms from drawer.

Your ARMS are in your MAGIC CHEST, pooplord!

> Remove CAKE from MAGIC CHEST.

Out of sympathy for John's perceived lack of arms, you pick up the CAKE for him and put it on his BED.

> John: Quickly retrieve arms from MAGIC CHEST.
You retrieve your FAKE ARMS from the chest. You use these for HILARIOUS ANTICS.

You CAPTCHALOGUE them in your SYLLADEX. You have no idea what that actually means though.

There are other items in the chest.

> John: Examine contents of chest.

In here you keep an array of humorous and mystical ARTIFACTS, each one a devastating weapon in the hands of a SKILLED MAGICIAN or a CUNNING PRANKSTER.

You are neither of these things.

Among the ARTIFACTS are: TWO (2) FAKE ARMS , ONE (1) PAIR OF TRICK HANDCUFFS, ONE (1) STUNT SWORD, ONE (1) MAGICIAN'S HAT, ONE (1) PAIR OF BEAGLE PUSS GLASSES, SEVERAL (~) SMOKE PELLETS, SEVERAL (~) BLOOD CAPSULES, and ONE (1) COPY OF COLONEL SASSACRE'S DAUNTING TEXT OF MAGICAL FRIVOLITY AND PRACTICAL JAPERY, and ONE (1) COPY OF HARRY ANDERSON'S ""WISE GUY"", BY MIKE CAVENEY.

Some of this stuff may come in handy at some point. For now, you decide to just take the SMOKE PELLETS.

> John: Captchalogue smoke pellets.

You stow the SMOKE PELLETS on one of your CAPTCHALOGUE CARDS in your SYLLADEX.

You still aren't totally sure what that means, but you are starting to get the hang of the vernacular at least.

You have two empty CAPTCHALOGUE CARDS remaining.

> John: Equip fake arms.
You aren't totally sure if ""EQUIP"" is a verb copasetic with the abstract behavioral medium in which you dwell, but you give it a try anyway.

Unfortunately, you cannot access the FAKE ARMS! Their card is underneath the one you just used to captchalogue the SMOKE PELLETS. You will have to use the pellets first in order to access the arms. But this is probably unadvisable, since you'd just make your room lousy with smoke!

Your SYLLADEX'S FETCH MODUS is currently dictated by the logic of a STACK DATA STRUCTURE. You were never all that great with data structures and you find the concept puzzling and mildly irritating.

But with any hope, perhaps you will advance new, more practical FETCH MODI for your SYLLADEX with a little more experience.

> John: Examine Problem Sleuth Poster.

Is it even possible to get any more hard boiled than that? You really doubt it. This poster was one of your wisest purchases.

There is a nice spot on the wall next to it. You've been meaning to hang another poster there soon.

> John: Read note on drawer.

This note is rich with the aromas of FATHERLY AFTERSHAVES AND COLOGNES.

Beside the note is a ROLLED UP POSTER.

> John: Take poster.

Another BIRTHDAY ARTIFACT. You wonder what is printed on the poster.

You'll need some way to hang it on your wall.
> John: Acquire hammer and nails. They will come in handy.

You first place the HAMMER into your SYLLADEX.

But now all of your CAPTCHALOGUE CARDS are full. You wonder what will happen if you try to take the NAILS?

You guess it doesn't hurt to try.

> John: Take nails.

You captchalogue FOUR (4) NAILS into the top card, and push all the ARTIFACTS down a card.

The FAKE ARMS are pushed entirely out of the deck!!!

Oh well. They're probably completely useless anyway. But you probably don't want to do that again, unless you want to drop the SMOKE PELLETS and suffer the consequences.

In any case, you now feel like you have gathered enough things to get down to business and do some really important stuff. The next thing you do will probably be exceptionally meaningful.

> John: Squawk like an imbecile and shit on your desk.

This is the dumbest idea you've had in weeks!!!

STUPID STUPID STUPID.

And yet the polished surface of your desk...

It beckons.

> John: Combine the nails and hammer.

You MERGE the top two cards.

The HAMMER and NAILS are now captchalogued on the same card and can be used together.

> John: Use hammer/nails on poster.

You use the HAMMER and NAILS card IN CONJUNCTION with the card beneath it.

> John: Nail poster to wall.

You use the HAMMER, NAILS, and POSTER on the blank space on the wall.

It's glorious. Exactly what you wanted. The old man really came through this time.

> John: Examine Con Air poster.

PUT THE BUNNY BACK IN THE BOX.

I SAID, PUT THE BUNNY BACK IN THE BOX.

WHY COULDN'T YOU PUT THE BUNNY BACK IN THE BOX?

> John: Examine Deep Impact poster.

Morgan Freeman's genteel, homespun mannerisms were perfect qualities for a president residing over a crisis.

OCEANS RISE. CITIES FALL. HOPE SURVIVES.

WOW.

Films about impending apocalypse fascinate you. Plus, a black president??? Now you've seen everything!

> John: Examine calendar.

You've marked your birthday, the 13th of April. Another day you marked was supposed to be the arrival date for the highly touted SBURB BETA LAUNCH.

It's been three days already. It's starting to become a sore subject with you.

> John: Eat cake.

You are sick to death of cake!!! You've been eating it all day. And you have no intention of clogging your SYLLADEX with it either. The CAKE stays put for now.

You hear a notice from your COMPUTER. Someone is messaging you.

> John: Examine incoming message.

You pull up to your COMPUTER. This is where you spend most of your time. You decorated your desktop with some rather handsome WALLPAPER which you made yourself. You are really proud of it.

Your desktop is also littered with various PROGRAMMING PROJECT FILES. You are so bad at programming sometimes you wonder why you even bother with it.

Your PESTERCHUM application is flashing. Someone is trying to get in touch with you.

> John: Open Pesterchum.

Only one of your CHUMS is logged in. He's sent you a message.

> John: Open message.

TG: hey so what sort of insane loot did you rake in today
EB: i got a little monsters poster, it's so awesome. i'm going to watch it again today, the applejuice scene was so funny.
TG: oh hell that is such a coincidence i just found an unopened container of apple juice in my closet it is like fucking christmas up in here
EB: ok thats fine, but i just have one question and then a word of caution. have you ever seen a movie called little monsters starring howie mandel and fred savage?
TG: but
TG: the seal on the bottle is unbroken
TG: are you suggesting someone put piss in my apple juice at the factory
EB: all im saying is don't you think monster howie mandel has the power to do something as simple as reseal a bottle?
EB: try using your brain numbnuts.
TG: why did the fat kid or whoever drank it know what piss tasted like
TG: i mean his reaction was nigh instantaneous
EB: it was the 15th day in a row howie mandel peed in his juice.
TG: ok i can accept that
TG: monster B-list celebrity douchebags are cunning and persistent pranksters
TG: also fred savage has a really punchable face
TG: but who cares about this lets stop talking about it
TG: did you get the beta yet
EB: no.
EB: did you?
TG: man i got two copies already
TG: but i dont care im not going to play it or anything the game sounds boring
TG: did you see how it got slammed in game bro????
EB: game bro is a joke and we both know it.
TG: yeah
TG: why dont you go check your mail maybe its there now
EB: alright.

> John: Look out window.

You see the view of your yard from your window.

Hanging from the tree is your TIRE SWING. In a kid's yard, a tree without a tire swing is like a proper gentleman without a monocle. That is to say, HE CAN HARDLY BE CONSIDERED A TERRIBLY PROPER GENTLEMAN AT ALL.

And there beside your driveway is the mailbox.

> John: Examine mailbox.

The little red arm-swingy-dealy thing or whatever it is called is flipped up!

What the hell is that thing called anyway. You do not have time for these semantics. The red flippy-lever thing means you have new mail. And that means the beta might be here!

> John: Go outside and check mailbox.

You are about to hurry down stairs when you hear a car pull into the driveway. It looks like your DAD has returned from the grocery store.

Oh great. He is beating you to the mail.

> John: Forget it. Check mail later.

If you go down stairs to get it, he will likely monopolize hours of your time. You decide to chill out up here for a while until the dust settles.

Sometimes you feel like you are trapped in this room. Stuck, if you will, in a sense which possibly borders on the titular.

And now your chum is pestering you again. The clockwork of friendship turns ceaselessly, operating the swing-lever dealies of harassment in perpetuity!

Whatever. The dude can just hold his damn horses.

> John: Examine games on CD rack.

You've put countless manhours into this assortment of quality titles.

> John: Read COLONEL SASSACRE'S DAUNTING TEXT.

You decide to consult with the Colonel's bottomless wisdom. Good grief this thing is huge. It could kill a cat if you dropped it.

But to really dig into this hefty book, you will have to captchalogue it. You are not sure you are ready to logjam your other ARTIFACTS beneath it just yet.

> John: Captchalogue fake arms again.

What did you just say?? You don't want to clog up your...

Oh, Jesus. In a momentary lapse of concentration, you accidentally captchalogue the arms again.

> John: Set Pesterchum status to ""bully"".

You don't think the situation is quite dire enough to go all the way to ""RANCOROUS"", but you still feel the PESTERCHUM client should reflect your mood change in some way.

""BULLY"" will have to do. You guess.

This unsurprisingly does nothing whatsoever.

Oh, right, you forgot your chum is still pestering you.

> John: Answer chum.

TG: is it there
TG: plz say yes
TG: maybe you can play with TT shes been pestering me all day about it
TG: shes mackin on me so hard all the time i start to feel embarrassed for her
TG: i mean not that i can blame her or anything
EB: yes, it is understandable because you are really attractive. i am attracted to you.
TG: thank you
EB: jk haha.
EB: no, i don't have it yet.
EB: my dad has the mail and i guess i have to go get it from him and see if it's there.
EB: and i've been busy spending all afternoon shitting around with my stupid sylladex.
EB: it's so frustrating.
TG: whats your modus
EB: what?
TG: how do you retrieve artifacts from it
EB: oh. like one at a time i guess. and if i put too much in, something falls out.
TG: stack?? hahahahahaha
EB: what is yours?
TG: hash map
TG: my bro taught me a few tricks he basically knows everything and is awesome
EB: what the hell is that?
TG: you should probably brush up on your data structures
EB: i guess.
TG: did you at least allocate your strife specibus
EB: no.
TG: it could free up a card for you
TG: plus let you attack stuff whenever things get too hot to handle
TG: which is never
TG: what have you got
EB: well, i've got a hammer but it's trapped under some arms.
TG: wow you really suck at this dont you
TG: just get rid of the arms and then allocate the hammer to the specibus
EB: how?
TG: i dont know just use the arms on any old thing and see if it works

> John: Combine fake arms with cake.

You stick the FAKE ARMS in the CAKE on your bed.

This definitely makes the CAKE at least 300% more hilarious. You're sure COLONEL SASSACRE would know the precise index of elevated hilarity.

> John: Allocate hammer to strife specibus.

You check the back of your STRIFE SPECIBUS for the KIND ABSTRATUS you have in mind for it.

> John: Select ""HAMMER"".

Your STRIFE SPECIBUS has been ALLOCATED with the HAMMERKIND ABSTRATUS.

The HAMMER has been moved from your CAPTCHALOGUE DECK to your STRIFE DECK.

> John: Report progress to TG.

EB: ok, i did it.
TG: hammerkind?
EB: yeah.
TG: ok that will be the permanent allocation for your specibus
TG: i guess i should have mentioned that
EB: uh...
TG: hope you like hammers dude!
EB: yeah, that's fine i guess. i can't imagine it's going to be all that relevant.

> John: Captchalogue Colonel's big book.

Now that you've got some space in your SYLLADEX to work with, you figure you might as well start squandering it immediately.

Ordinarily this ridiculous book would be way too heavy to carry around in any practical way. You guess maybe this is one respect in which the cards present some convenience.

> John: Examine GameBro Magazine.
> John: Read article.
> John: Captchalogue GameBro.

It might come in handy if you ever need something that burns easily.

> John: Captchalogue magician's hat.

You expend your final card on the MAGICIAN'S HAT.

> John: Get funny glasses too.

You don't have a free card in your SYLLADEX!

However, you are able to MERGE the BEAGLE PUSS with the MAGICIAN'S HAT to create a CLEVER DISGUISE.

> John: Wear disguise to fool dad.

John? Who is this ""John"" you speak of? You are quite certain there has never been, nor ever will be...

Yeah, this is a really shitty disguise.

While you are wearing the items, they remain on the card, but it is temporarily removed from the deck, thus freeing up the cards beneath it.

> John: Leave room.

You exit into the HALLWAY.

On one wall hangs a picture of a fella who sure knows how to have a laugh, a man after your own heart. You always thought he looked a lot like Michael Cera. But your DAD swears on the many HALLOWED TOMBS of Egypt that it is not. You're not sure about that though.

On the other wall is one of your DAD'S stupid clowns. Or HARLEQUINS, as he is quick to correct anyone who would venture such brazen assumption.

> John: Go downstairs.

The accursed odor of fresh baking wafts into your newfound nostrils. Something is brewing in the KITCHEN. It must be the connivings of your arch nemesis, BETTY CROCKER, and the rich, buttery aroma of her plot stinks to high heaven.

This mission is going to be more difficult than you imagined.

> John: Admire harlequins.

You check out the shelves of FANCIFUL HARLEQUINS.

Look at this fucking garbage. You hate this stuff. Funny is funny, but your DAD sure can be a real cornball.

Sometimes at night you pray for burglars.

> John: Examine fireplace.

A bright orange flame flickers in the FIREPLACE. It doesn't matter that it's April and not terribly chilly outside. In a home, a FIREPLACE needs a fire, because that's what FIREPLACE is for. A fire BELONGS in a FIREPLACE, dammit, cata(ptcha)gorically, at all times, without exception.

As domestic myth of unaccountable origin holds, a home borrows the spirit of the flame for as long as it makes a guest of it, much as the moon takes liberty with the sun's rays.

""The moon's an arrant thief, and her pale fire she snatches from the sun."" -Mark Twain

You are almost certain Mark Twain said that.

> John: Toss GameBro into fire.

It doesn't burn as quickly as you hoped.

Each GAMEBRO MAGAZINE is guaranteed to be printed on 40% recycled asbestos. For big ups to Mother Earth, yo.

> John: Fondly regard cremation.

You examine the SACRED URN containing your departed NANNA'S ASHES.

When your father gives her portrait a wistful glance now and then, you can tell it brings back painful memories. A tall bookshelf. A ladder. An unabridged COLONEL SASSACRE'S.

He never wants to talk about it.

> John: Topple urn.

You clumsily mishandle the SACRED URN. Ash is everywhere.

In retrospect, upon mulling cinematic tropes regarding ash-filled urns, this outcome was a virtual certainty.

You'd probably better clean it up before DAD finds it.

> John: Combine father's pipe with clever disguise.

You think now would be a good time to beef up your CLEVER DISGUISE.

> John: Examine oversized gift.

Contemplating what could be inside this package is sort of exciting, but it makes you a little nervous at the same time.

> John: Open large present.

Oh hell no.

> John: Captchalogue ashes.

First you prop the HARLEQUIN DOLL up on the couch. Having it in the middle of the floor sprawled out all akimbo like that struck you as unseemly.

You captchalogue the ASHES to your available card.

> John: Combine ashes with urn.

You merge the SACRED URN with the ASHES.

Most of the ASH is back in the URN, but it's a total mess. Really it probably would have been tidier if you just used a broom and dustpan.

> John: Put urn back.

No one will be the wiser.

Except maybe for people with eyes.

> John: Go get fake arms again.

You just got another BRILLIANT idea for something to do with those pointless arms. You pry them out of the CAKE and captchalogue them.

Looks like PESTERCHUM is acting up again."

Give me a gun, give me a drink
Pour it on up and get out of the way
You gon' light a stick of dynamite and I'm about to blow you away
Pick yourself up, clean yourself off
Better learn to take a punch if you're gonna talk tough
Here's a shovel and a plot, it's a six foot deep kinda day
You can dig your own damn grave"
Michael Ray,Her World or Mine,country,"One of us still has our picture taped up on the dash

One of us don't even notice when the radio plays that song
One of us breaks down and has to pull over whenever it comes on
Nah there ain't no in between, when it comes to her and me


One of us moved on, one of us got stuck
One of us is drinkin' just for fun, one of us drinkin' to get drunk
One of us sleeps good, and one of us hates to face the night
Just depends if you're talkin' about her world or mine


There's a number on a phone that one of us erased
There's a ""late-night can we try again?"" call one of us wants to make
'Cause one of us can't even think about bein' in another's arms
And there's a car in the drive that stayed all night, where one of us used to park


One of us moved on, one of us got stuck
One of us is drinkin' just for fun, one of us drinkin' to get drunk
One of us sleeps good, and one of us hates to face the night
Just depends if you're talkin' about her world or mine

Why is everybody telling everybody what you have done?

And knowing you, you're probably way over me


But God, we were so alive
I was a kid on a carnival ride
Holdin' my breath 'til the moment
When you were gonna leave me too soon
But I'd do it all over
'Cause, damn, it was good knowing you


Knowing you was a free-fall from a hundred thousand feet
When you don't even care where you land
And knowing you was the kind of rush that you feel
When you finally get to sit in with the band
And knowing you, you're still a tumbleweed
I only wish that you would tumble back to me

I got the boy, and she got the man

Fake IDs to get into those spring break bars
Backwoods on a four wheel, hanging on tight
I can still feel my racing heart
And now you're cleaned up with a hair cut, nice tie and shoes
If things were different and I had a choice, which would I choose?

I was looking at all the life
There were plants and birds and rocks and things
There was sand and hills and rings
The first thing I met was a fly with a buzz
And the sky with no clouds
The heat was hot and the ground was dry
But the air was full of sound


I've been through the desert on a horse with no name
It felt good to be out of the rain
In the desert, you can't remember your name
'Cause there ain't no one for to give you no pain

Under the cities lies a heart made of ground

Try to kill it all away

What have I become
My sweetest friend?
Everyone I know
Goes away in the end
And you could have it all
My empire of dirt
I will let you down
I will make you hurt

I cannot repair

Joe Diffie,John Deere Green,country,"They were farm kids way down in Dixie
They met in high school in the '60s
Everyone knew it was love from the start
One July, in the midnight hour
He climbed up on the water tower
Stood on the rail and painted a ten-foot heart


In John Deere green, on a hot summer night
He wrote, ""Billy Bob loves Charlene,"" in letters three-foot-high
And the whole town said that he should've used red
But it looked good to Charlene in John Deere green


They settled down on eighty acres
Raisin' sweet corn, kids, and tomatoes
They went together like a hand in a glove
On a clear day, from their front yard
If you look and know what to look for
Off to the east, you can still read his words of love

But I don't know how not to think about you
When it's late at night and quiet
And I know that I ought to be the one who is strong and just moves on
But I'll probably turn down your road, knock knock on your door
Fall back in your arms, wake up in the morning
Hating myself for the way that I can't help the way I still want you


I just don't know how not to, how not to, how not to
I just don't know how not to, how not to, how not to


You're like second nature baby, you're just like breathin'

Cody Johnson,Holes,country,"There's a picture frame hangin' at the end of the hall
Pile of dust on the floor where my fist met the drywall
That's my MO, leavin' somethin' broke everywhere I go
Holes


There's a rusty old truck door sittin' in a field
That I filled full of buckshot every time I got
Mad at something over nothin' didn't matter at all


Holes
In my life
Down in my bones
From my heart
To my soul


There's a lonely space on a big brass bed
Where we first made love
And she'd lay her head on my shoulder
Before I told her it was over
Holes


There's a million conversations with my old man
'Bout who he was, and who I am
That I never had, I just wouldn't listen
I just kept digging myself down in 'em

In the jingle jangle mornin' I'll come followin' you


Though you might hear laughing, spinning, swinging madly across the sun
It's not aimed at anyone, it's just escaping on the run
And but for the sky there are no fences facing
And if you hear vague traces of skipping reels of rhyme
To your tambourine in time, it's just a ragged clown behind
I wouldn't pay it any mind
It's just a shadow you're seeing that he's chasing


Hey, Mr. Tambourine Man, play a song for me
I'm not sleepy, and there is no place I'm going to
Hey, Mr. Tambourine Man, play a song for me
In the jingle jangle mornin' I'll come followin' you




And take me disappearing through the smoke rings of my mind
Down the foggy ruins of time, far past the frozen leaves
The haunted, frightened trees, out to the windy beach
Far from the twisted reach of crazy sorrow
Yes, to dance beneath the diamond sky with one hand waving free
Silhouetted by the sea, circled by the circus sands
With all memory and fate driven deep beneath the waves
Let me forget about today until tomorrow

Hey, Mr. Tambourine Man, play a song for me
I'm not sleepy, and there is no place I'm going to
Hey, Mr. Tambourine Man, play a song for me
In the jingle jangle mornin' I'll come followin' you"
Kacey Musgraves;Leon Bridges,Present Without A Bow,country,"We've been moving too fast and we should slow down
Come and sit by the fire, stop rushing around
'Cause this time of year, it's meant for two
So don't leave me lonely if I don't have you


The holiday's just another day that's cold
Standing all alone under the mistletoe
I don't feel the cheer, ooh, without you here
There's no red and white stripes on a candy cane
And Silent Night just wouldn't sound the same
Where'd the magic go?
All I know is me without you is like a present without a bow


Before we know, the wreath will come down
The halls won't be decked, there'll be no snow on the ground
The new year will come and bring lots of change, baby
And if I'm not with you girl, sippin' on champagne


The holiday's just another day that's cold

Showing her how to shoot a combo
And he don't know


I dug my key into the side
Of his pretty little souped up four-wheel drive
Carved my name into his leather seats
I took a Louisville Slugger to both headlights
Slashed a hole in all four tires

White-trash version of Shania karaoke

Upchurch,White Lightning,country,"Some people go for gold, then lose sight of their shine
And the sparkle that once was, gets tarnished in mind
They forget what they was after they fall off the track
And their vision that was vivid gets lost in pitch black
Age starts to take place like a bomb that keeps tickin'
And they regret not chasing after it after they had the ambition
The ambition fades away like the red on a rose
And the regret sucks the life from everybody I suppose
But my rose ain't red, it won't die but ain't fake
But when I die, I'll drown myself in these lyrics I speak
White Lightnin'
(Chasin' white lightnin', chasing white lightnin')


I ain't no stranger to the rain, I put the sunshine in my grey clouds
Worked hard for where I'm at, so it's easier for me to sleep now
But I don't sleep I walk the roads from stop sign to street name
No yellow marks on these back roads, so I paint the lines that pave my way
And these framed pics on my wall from my top tens on these music charts
Represent these small towns you'll never see with a big heart
And these lyrics in my songs are the warm spot like a Carhartt
Don't ever forget that one place that made you that person that you are


Many miles I've roamed wheels turnin' on that one lane
Last years boots, broken soles chasin' one thing
Caught up in the storm of life it gets me excited

I'd save every day like a treasure and then
Again, I would spend them with you

There was sand and hills and rings

And the sky with no clouds
The heat was hot and the ground was dry
But the air was full of sound


I've been through the desert on a horse with no name

We've got a long way to go and a short time to get there

Upchurch,Traveler,country,"I stay walkin' the woods, gettin' lost in my thoughts
Wonderin' if this path is the one that I'm 'posed to be on
But I do get lost in a daze, way deep back off in my mind
And I realize camera flashes really will make you go blind
And not just blind in a sense and not the cents that make dollars
I'm not gonna go crazy over shit to me that don't really matter
Who cares if you got money, shit, dog, I got money too
But when you drop the materialistic shit then who the fuck are you?
And I'm just strollin' through fields, call me the phantom of Dixie
With the devil creepin' behind, always slick, tryin' to come trick me
But I ain't payin' attention to the shadows that lurk my back
I'm here to be a star and have folks down the road read out my path


He was a traveler, a rockstar, and a healer
Four wheels spinin' in the sunset through the night
Into the dark unknown, guns are loaded
But he always made it home before the light


I grew up with my Paw Paw watchin' reruns of Lonesome Dove
Tombstone and Mash, I'd dress up in his cowboy hat some
And I grab his guitar and pretend to be Johnny Cash on a stage
Just standin' in the kitchen when I didn't know how to play
And I'm surrounded by snakes but I'm the one with the venom
I got the voice of the good people, mainstream won't even listen
I can't even get two seconds, shit, I'm the black sheep I guess
But I'm gonna conquer these obstacles with the blade at my neck
Yeah, I stress out so I smoke and Mary Jane picks me up
My mind-state in the moonlight is somethin' powerful from above
So when the full moon cast a beam and the beam is shinin' on me
I guess it's time to hit the stage like the animal I am

Red hot from the beginnin'
Heartbeats racin'
Taste the salt on your lips that I was kissin'


Thought it would always be that way
'Til I felt the seasons change
Maybe we weren't meant to last forever anyway


Just like a song for the summer
When we were young, we never thought it would end
Just gettin' lost in each other, we'd play it 'til it's over
Then play it all over again
We sang along-long-long in the sunshine
All night, so right 'til it was gone
Just like a song
A song for the summer, song for the summer

We were dancin' in the water
Cool breeze, your eyes

Kiss like poison and I'm willing to die
With a big fat smile because


She's got lips covered in honey
One with the weeds, don't need money
She's fire and I want her to burn me

Baby, just don't choke (Baby, just don't choke)

But, baby, just don't choke (Baby, just don't choke)


I'm high and I'm sittin' here zoned out
Drivin' 'round town in a big green smoke cloud
The windows fogged up, they refuse to roll down
I'm tryna touch the stars and get there in no time
Clothes gone, lights off in a dually
The backseat's the only throne that I'm rulin'
So, bust a blunt down and roll that love scene
And flick my Bic, come here and smoke with me

Wandering the city street
Another face in the crowd
Head looking down
Lost in the sound of a lonely melody
Empty pockets at a roulette
Always landing on a lost bet
Just live for the spin and hope for the win
Go all in just to lose again

She goes out on Saturday night
She comes home late, she don't have to fight
And she thinks, ""Ain't got it all, but I got it alright""
And for a minute she's glad that she ain't like
Everyone she knows


She's bored with all the boys

I met up with a gambler, we were both too tired to sleep
So we took turns a-starin' out the window at the darkness
'Til boredom overtook us and he began to speak


He said, ""Son, I've made a life out of readin' people's faces
And knowin' what their cards were by the way they held their eyes
So if you don't mind my sayin', I can see you're out of aces
For a taste of your whiskey I'll give you some advice""


So I handed him my bottle and he drank down my last swallow
Then he bummed a cigarette and asked me for a light
And the night got deathly quiet and his face lost all expression
Said, ""If you're gonna play the game, boy, you gotta learn to play it right""


You got to know when to hold 'em, know when to fold 'em
Know when to walk away and know when to run
You never count your money when you're sittin' at the table
There'll be time enough for countin' when the dealing's done

Is knowin' what to throw away and knowing what to keep
'Cause every hand's a winner and every hand's a loser

He's watching her go

Look what I've gone and done
Took all my promises
And broke 'em all one by one

Two empty bottles of wine
A ghost in an empty bed
And a diamond that lost its shine
Nobody left to blame
I've ruined everything
Look at the mess I'm in


Look at these painted walls
Listen to what they say
You coulda had it all
But you let it slip away
So now I'm just doin' time
Hopin' your mind will change
A head full of your goodbyes
And a heart like a hurricane
Too late to apologize
And I'm a little too drunk to drivе

So I hung my head and cried

You are my sunshine, my only sunshine
You make me happy when skies are gray
You never know, dear, how much I love you
Please, don't take my sunshine away

I'll always love you and make you happy
If you will only say the same
But if you leave me and love another
You'll regret it all someday

Joe Diffie,Pickup Man,country,"Well, I got my first truck when I was three
Drove a hundred thousand miles on my knees
Hauled marbles and rocks and thought twice before
I hauled a Barbie Doll bed for the girl next door
She tried to pay me with a kiss and I began to understand
There's something women like about a pickup man


When I turned sixteen, I saved a few hundred bucks
My first car was a pickup truck
I was cruisin' the town and the first girl I see
Was Bobbie Jo Gentry, the homecomin' queen
She flagged me down and climbed up in the cab
And said, ""I never knew you were a pickup man""


You can set my truck on fire and roll it down a hill
And I still wouldn't trade it for a Coupe DeVille
I got an eight-foot bed that never has to be made
You know, if it weren't for trucks we wouldn't have tailgates
I met all my wives in traffic jams
There's just something women like about a pickup man


Most Friday nights I can be found
In the bed of my truck on an old chaise lounge

Shouted for a drink over a screaming guitar
A drunk on a stool tried to mess with my head
But I didn't even listen to a word he said
I knew somewhere amid all this distraction
Was a little less talk and a lot more action

And you say you've gotta get your things together
You just gotta leave before you change your mind

Travis Tritt,Take It Easy,country,"Well, I'm a runnin' down the road, tryin' to loosen my load
I've got seven women on my mind:
Four that wanna own me, two that wanna stone me
One says she's a friend of mine
Take it easy, take it easy
Don't let the sound of your own wheels drive you crazy
Lighten up while you still can, don't even try to understand
Just find a place to make your stand and take it easy

Well, I'm a standin' on a corner in Winslow, Arizona
And such a fine sight to see:
It's a girl, my Lord, in a flat bed Ford
Slowin' down to take a look at me
Come on, baby, don't say maybe
I gotta know if your sweet love is gonna save me
We may lose and we may win though we will never be here again
So open up, I'm climbin' in, so take it easy

Well, I'm a runnin' down the road, tryin' to loosen my load
Got a world of trouble on my mind
Lookin' for a lover who won't blow my cover
She's so hard to find
Take it easy, take it easy
Don't let the sound of your own wheels make you crazy
Come on, baby, don't say maybe

Held by a man who don't know what he has
How can I make you see...


You should be loved, loved, loved, loved, loved

You should be missed by somebody
Kissed by somebody
Loved by somebody, like me

If I were him
Yeah, if I were him
I'd never leave your side
I'd take you out and take you home

I'd never steal you from his arms
I don't mean him any harm
But I can't keep my silence as hard as I try
All I'm trying to say is...

Hammered nails all in a row
I've worked on cars, and I've sold things too
All I need is this pickup truck
A little bit of love
And a whole lot of luck
Come Friday night I know just what to do

I hear a big ole crowd
Screaming loud, bartender says last call
Come on back tomorrow night
I'm sure we'll have a ball
I'm just an ordinary guy all week long
Till I step inside this bar

It's back to the same ole grind

Not a care in the world, just trying to beat the heat
Body like an hourglass, sand on her feet
I can't help but stare cause I got the best seat
Just when I thought it couldn't get any hotter you slid on in
Said, ""I'm a little hot and bothered, if you know what I mean
Let's crank it up to a hundred degrees""


You hit me like fire, shot me like a bullet
Burned me up and down, no way to cool it
But every time you kiss me it's like sunshine and whiskey
Like a bottle of Jack straight to the head
One shot, two shot, Coppertone red
Every time you kiss me it's like sunshine and whiskey


I was slow driving south with the top drop down
Her hair in the wind, Tom Petty up loud
You gave me that look, you licked them lips
I said, ""Hang on baby, better pull over for this""

A six foot four, solid rock when he stood
He'd hunt with a hatchet and his own bare hands
Refused welfare, only lived off the land
Drove an '87 Dodge, straight pipes out the back
Stocked his house with white-tail racks
He's a rebel, a redneck, grew up in the sticks

His shirt says Ralph but his real name's Fred
Got grease on his hands and sweat on his head
Pants oil black and arms are scarred
And knuckles more busted than his credit card
Spends weekdays working under the hood

Come Friday at five he'll collect that pay
Pop a top on a cold one at the end of the day

I told him chasing a dollar
And in between sips of coffee
He poured this wisdom out
Said ""If you want my two cents on making a dollar count


Buy dirt
Find the one you can't live without
Get a ring, let your knee hit the ground
Do what you love but call it work
And throw a little money in the plate at church
Send your prayers up and your roots down deep
Add a few limbs to your family tree
And watch their pencils marks, and the grass in the yard
All grow up
'Cause the truth about it is it all goes by real quick
You can't buy happiness
But you can buy dirt""

Is picking you up, so I think I'm gonna risk it

Off to the war
And we ain't won it yet
But we'll come back for more
And as I watch the battleships sailing away
From right where you left me next to Galveston Bay

And asked if he could buy me a drink
He said I wish I could sing and play guitar man you've got it made
I said before we go and toast to that, there's something I gotta say

Wouldn't take me long to pack
And I'd give it up, I'd give it in
If only I, could see her again
Just took this long to see, that this ain't where I need to be
I've had too much fun, I'm headed north on 21

Made a lot of good friends, but lost them just as fast
You can't see the real world, through the bottom of a glass
Ain't even got a dog, cause I'm always on the road
Don't even call home, even a letter wrote
But if I could see the bright lights of Montgomery, Alabam'
Take this long road back up home, and never take it down

Said bless this little heart he's an excitable boy

Running eighty miles an hour in a thirty mile zone
Steal a little kiss- Skip a little school
Break another heart bend another rule
Cop tells the principal he's only making noise
Cut the kid some slack he's an excitable boy

I get a little carried away
Never meant to do nobody no harm

No open door
Nowhere to return
Where will I go
Where do I belong
Where's the end of my way
Where will I stay, where will I go?

My life is hopeless
Nowhere to turn
Where do I fit in
Where do I belong
I don't follow footprints
I wanna make my own
Wherever I go
There was someone else

The answer to this quest of life:
Will I find my way
To refresh my soul
Exchange for promises and hope

He didn't believe in heaven or damnation being worse
He's laid down in the dirt

Born out of this ever-loving mud

My mama was no angel, shе was more than just a nurse
She thought it was a charity to keep us kids from getting hurt

Listen to the fireplace roar
So really, I'd better scurry
Beautiful, please don't hurry

I'll put some records on while I pour

Baby, it's bad out there
Say, what's in this drink?
No cabs to be had out there
I wish I knew how
Your eyes are like starlight tonight
To break this spell

Oh up to your knees out there

I thrill when you touch my hand

How can you do this thing to me?

Lee Bains + The Glory Fires,Whitewash,rock,"There we sat
In fluorescent haloes
The tiny flowering redemptions
Of sharecroppers and miners and slaves
Offering up to our class
Beneath the TV, the flag and the cross
Our ridge-and-valley twangs and drawls
Birthmarks to be scrubbed away

I don’t want to be a whitewash
I don’t want to be an absence
I don’t want to be the great silence
I want to be—

I don’t want to be a whitewash
I don’t want to be nobody
I don’t want to be from noplace
I want to be—

In that little formica nook
Ladies at the steamtable, men from the scrapyard
Curling wisps from cornbread and collards
The soul of home, of souls forced west
The landlord will sell Ms. Glen’s lease
To continental cafes and unblinking empire
Pulling this scrap of red clay from those who
Loved her through the worst, who loved her best

I want to be—

Floating above
Your scrapped-together smoker
In that hazy little yard
On the sleepy Eastside
Smiling through blue strands of smoke
At everybody passing—
You’re singing
As if
Heaven
Is
Other folks

You might could sell them a book
Set in the boutiques of some blanched borough
In the sterile, phantom code of the mobile, modern
Skinny, shiny, and guilt-free
But you belong to the Free State of Winston
Her pines creak in your words, high and lonesome:
“I’ve got a people, and a history
And a place bearing down on me.”
I don’t want to be a whitewash
Turning places into sets
Turning people into objects
I want to be—

I don’t want to be a whitewash
Don’t want power over anybody
Don’t want dominion over anyplace
I want to be—

I don’t want to be a whitewash
I don’t want to be a whitewash

Tip toeing over ego trip wire
Soft steppin on eggshells as hell beckons
A bed of black rose petals on my twenty second
With twenty seconds on the clock I kept many guessin'
A game of death threats met with defiance
So I bring stones for the riots
While the right side of the brain extends through computer science
Flicks fictionalise our lives
In alliance with the Queen in the core of the hive
Breeding parasites
The wise read and analyse the scrolls
Stolen souls dissolve in alcohol
Master drunken pole
A cold-hearted defence in this dungeon hole
I hold hope for the globe in a closed palm
Locked in a gold heart
Lost and emotionally charged
I chart progress through this pain staking process
Elimination of the grotesque (no less)

Cyanide drips from the vinyl
My vital signs fade, I'm trapped in a pessimist's mind-state

Indica stick sticky fingers
Balanced on the brink of drinking binges
While friends sink syringes into their skin
And it could all end in an instance
With no one to discipline the infants
Walking the ledge I stay nimble as ninjas
My pen nib inches closer and closer
The ghosts in my dome stay closed in a coma
Crows overhead twisted as the trail we tred
Most failed or fled, ended up jailed or dead
But never me
Eyes in the back of my head for any enemy
Ready for them backstabbers
Suited and booted on this black Sabbath
Truly polluted by the pain I paint the blues on a blank canvas

Pleasure,Little by little,pop,"CHAPTER 15: AN INVITATION IN WRITING

The next day, November 9, I woke up only after a long, twelve–hour slumber. Conseil, a creature of habit, came to ask ""how master's night went,"" and to offer his services. He had left his Canadian friend sleeping like a man who had never done anything else.

I let the gallant lad babble as he pleased, without giving him much in the way of a reply. I was concerned about Captain Nemo's absence during our session the previous afternoon, and I hoped to see him again today.

Soon I had put on my clothes, which were woven from strands of seashell tissue. More than once their composition provoked comments from Conseil. I informed him that they were made from the smooth, silken filaments with which the fan mussel, a type of seashell quite abundant along Mediterranean beaches, attaches itself to rocks. In olden times, fine fabrics, stockings, and gloves were made from such filaments, because they were both very soft and very warm. So the Nautilus's crew could dress themselves at little cost, without needing a thing from cotton growers, sheep, or silkworms on shore.

As soon as I was dressed, I made my way to the main lounge. It was deserted.

I dove into studying the conchological treasures amassed inside the glass cases. I also investigated the huge plant albums that were filled with the rarest marine herbs, which, although they were pressed and dried, still kept their wonderful colors. Among these valuable water plants, I noted various seaweed: some Cladostephus verticillatus, peacock's tails, fig–leafed caulerpa, grain–bearing beauty bushes, delicate rosetangle tinted scarlet, sea colander arranged into fan shapes, mermaid's cups that looked like the caps of squat mushrooms and for years had been classified among the zoophytes; in short, a complete series of algae.

The entire day passed without my being honored by a visit from Captain Nemo. The panels in the lounge didn't open. Perhaps they didn't want us to get tired of these beautiful things.

The Nautilus kept to an east–northeasterly heading, a speed of twelve miles per hour, and a depth between fifty and sixty meters.

Next day, November 10: the same neglect, the same solitude. I didn't see a soul from the crew. Ned and Conseil spent the better part of the day with me. They were astonished at the captain's inexplicable absence. Was this eccentric man ill? Did he want to change his plans concerning us?

But after all, as Conseil noted, we enjoyed complete freedom, we were daintily and abundantly fed. Our host had kept to the terms of his agreement. We couldn't complain, and moreover the very uniqueness of our situation had such generous rewards in store for us, we had no grounds for criticism.

That day I started my diary of these adventures, which has enabled me to narrate them with the most scrupulous accuracy; and one odd detail: I wrote it on paper manufactured from marine eelgrass.

Early in the morning on November 11, fresh air poured through the Nautilus's interior, informing me that we had returned to the surface of the ocean to renew our oxygen supply. I headed for the central companionway and climbed onto the platform.

It was six o'clock. I found the weather overcast, the sea gray but calm. Hardly a billow. I hoped to encounter Captain Nemo there—would he come? I saw only the helmsman imprisoned in his glass–windowed pilothouse. Seated on the ledge furnished by the hull of the skiff, I inhaled the sea's salty aroma with great pleasure.
Little by little, the mists were dispersed under the action of the sun's rays. The radiant orb cleared the eastern horizon. Under its gaze, the sea caught on fire like a trail of gunpowder. Scattered on high, the clouds were colored in bright, wonderfully shaded hues, and numerous ""ladyfingers"" warned of daylong winds.

But what were mere winds to this Nautilus, which no storms could intimidate!

So I was marveling at this delightful sunrise, so life–giving and cheerful, when I heard someone climbing onto the platform.

I was prepared to greet Captain Nemo, but it was his chief officer who appeared—whom I had already met during our first visit with the captain. He advanced over the platform, not seeming to notice my presence. A powerful spyglass to his eye, he scrutinized every point of the horizon with the utmost care. Then, his examination over, he approached the hatch and pronounced a phrase whose exact wording follows below. I remember it because, every morning, it was repeated under the same circumstances. It ran like this:

    ""Nautron respoc lorni virch.""

What it meant I was unable to say.

These words pronounced, the chief officer went below again. I thought the Nautilus was about to resume its underwater navigating. So I went down the hatch and back through the gangways to my stateroom.

Five days passed in this way with no change in our situation. Every morning I climbed onto the platform. The same phrase was pronounced by the same individual. Captain Nemo did not appear.

I was pursuing the policy that we had seen the last of him, when on November 16, while reentering my stateroom with Ned and Conseil, I found a note addressed to me on the table.

I opened it impatiently. It was written in a script that was clear and neat but a bit ""Old English"" in style, its characters reminding me of German calligraphy.

The note was worded as follows:

     Professor Aronnax

     Aboard the Nautilus
     November 16, 1867

     Captain Nemo invites Professor Aronnax on a hunting trip that will take place tomorrow morning in his Crespo Island forests. He hopes nothing will prevent the professor from attending, and he looks forward with pleasure to the professor's companions joining him.

     CAPTAIN NEMO,

     Commander of the Nautilus.

""A hunting trip!"" Ned exclaimed.

""And in his forests on Crespo Island!"" Conseil added.

""But does this mean the old boy goes ashore?"" Ned Land went on.

""That seems to be the gist of it,"" I said, rereading the letter.

""Well, we've got to accept!"" the Canadian answered. ""Once we're on solid ground, we'll figure out a course of action. Besides, it wouldn't pain me to eat a couple slices of fresh venison!""

Without trying to reconcile the contradictions between Captain Nemo's professed horror of continents or islands and his invitation to go hunting in a forest, I was content to reply:

""First let's look into this Crespo Island.""

I consulted the world map; and in latitude 32° 40' north and longitude 167° 50' west, I found an islet that had been discovered in 1801 by Captain Crespo, which old Spanish charts called Rocca de la Plata, in other words, ""Silver Rock."" So we were about 1,800 miles from our starting point, and by a slight change of heading, the Nautilus was bringing us back toward the southeast.

I showed my companions this small, stray rock in the middle of the north Pacific.
""If Captain Nemo does sometimes go ashore,"" I told them, ""at least he only picks desert islands!""

Ned Land shook his head without replying; then he and Conseil left me. After supper was served me by the mute and emotionless steward, I fell asleep; but not without some anxieties.

When I woke up the next day, November 17, I sensed that the Nautilus was completely motionless. I dressed hurriedly and entered the main lounge.

Captain Nemo was there waiting for me. He stood up, bowed, and asked if it suited me to come along.

Since he made no allusion to his absence the past eight days, I also refrained from mentioning it, and I simply answered that my companions and I were ready to go with him.

""Only, sir,"" I added, ""I'll take the liberty of addressing a question to you.""

""Address away, Professor Aronnax, and if I'm able to answer, I will.""

""Well then, Captain, how is it that you've severed all ties with the shore, yet you own forests on Crespo Island?""

""Professor,"" the captain answered me, ""these forests of mine don't bask in the heat and light of the sun. They aren't frequented by lions, tigers, panthers, or other quadrupeds. They're known only to me. They grow only for me. These forests aren't on land, they're actual underwater forests.""

""Underwater forests!"" I exclaimed.

""Yes, professor.""

""And you're offering to take me to them?""

""Precisely.""

""On foot?""

""Without getting your feet wet.""

""While hunting?""

""While hunting.""

""Rifles in hand?""

""Rifles in hand.""

I stared at the Nautilus's commander with an air anything but flattering to the man.

""Assuredly,"" I said to myself, ""he's contracted some mental illness. He's had a fit that's lasted eight days and isn't over even yet. What a shame! I liked him better eccentric than insane!""

These thoughts were clearly readable on my face; but Captain Nemo remained content with inviting me to follow him, and I did so like a man resigned to the worst.

We arrived at the dining room, where we found breakfast served.

""Professor Aronnax,"" the captain told me, ""I beg you to share my breakfast without formality. We can chat while we eat. Because, although I promised you a stroll in my forests, I made no pledge to arrange for your encountering a restaurant there. Accordingly, eat your breakfast like a man who'll probably eat dinner only when it's extremely late.""

I did justice to this meal. It was made up of various fish and some slices of sea cucumber, that praiseworthy zoophyte, all garnished with such highly appetizing seaweed as the Porphyra laciniata and the Laurencia primafetida. Our beverage consisted of clear water to which, following the captain's example, I added some drops of a fermented liquor extracted by the Kamchatka process from the seaweed known by name as Rhodymenia palmata.

At first Captain Nemo ate without pronouncing a single word. Then he told me:

""Professor, when I proposed that you go hunting in my Crespo forests, you thought I was contradicting myself. When I informed you that it was an issue of underwater forests, you thought I'd gone insane. Professor, you must never make snap judgments about your fellow man.""

""But, Captain, believe me—""

""Kindly listen to me, and you'll see if you have grounds for accusing me of insanity or self–contradiction.""

""I'm all attention.""

""Professor, you know as well as I do that a man can live underwater so long as he carries with him his own supply of breathable air. For underwater work projects, the workman wears a waterproof suit with his head imprisoned in a metal capsule, while he receives air from above by means of force pumps and flow regulators.""

""That's the standard equipment for a diving suit,"" I said.

""Correct, but under such conditions the man has no freedom. He's attached to a pump that sends him air through an india–rubber hose; it's an actual chain that fetters him to the shore, and if we were to be bound in this way to the Nautilus, we couldn't go far either.""

Then how do you break free?"" I asked.

""We use the Rouquayrol–Denayrouze device, invented by two of your fellow countrymen but refined by me for my own special uses, thereby enabling you to risk these new physiological conditions without suffering any organic disorders. It consists of a tank built from heavy sheet iron in which I store air under a pressure of fifty atmospheres. This tank is fastened to the back by means of straps, like a soldier's knapsack. Its top part forms a box where the air is regulated by a bellows mechanism and can be released only at its proper tension. In the Rouquayrol device that has been in general use, two india–rubber hoses leave this box and feed to a kind of tent that imprisons the operator's nose and mouth; one hose is for the entrance of air to be inhaled, the other for the exit of air to be exhaled, and the tongue closes off the former or the latter depending on the breather's needs. But in my case, since I face considerable pressures at the bottom of the sea, I needed to enclose my head in a copper sphere, like those found on standard diving suits, and the two hoses for inhalation and exhalation now feed to that sphere.""

""That's perfect, Captain Nemo, but the air you carry must be quickly depleted; and once it contains no more than 15% oxygen, it becomes unfit for breathing.""

""Surely, but as I told you, Professor Aronnax, the Nautilus's pumps enable me to store air under considerable pressure, and given this circumstance, the tank on my diving equipment can supply breathable air for nine or ten hours.""

""I've no more objections to raise,"" I replied. ""I'll only ask you, Captain: how can you light your way at the bottom of the ocean?""

""With the Ruhmkorff device, Professor Aronnax. If the first is carried on the back, the second is fastened to the belt. It consists of a Bunsen battery that I activate not with potassium dichromate but with sodium. An induction coil gathers the electricity generated and directs it to a specially designed lantern. In this lantern one finds a glass spiral that contains only a residue of carbon dioxide gas. When the device is operating, this gas becomes luminous and gives off a continuous whitish light. Thus provided for, I breathe and I see.""

""Captain Nemo, to my every objection you give such crushing answers, I'm afraid to entertain a single doubt. However, though I have no choice but to accept both the Rouquayrol and Ruhmkorff devices, I'd like to register some reservations about the rifle with which you'll equip me.""

""But it isn't a rifle that uses gunpowder,"" the captain replied.

""Then it's an air gun?""

""Surely. How can I make gunpowder on my ship when I have no saltpeter, sulfur, or charcoal?""

""Even so,"" I replied, ""to fire underwater in a medium that's 855 times denser than air, you'd have to overcome considerable resistance.""

""That doesn't necessarily follow. There are certain Fulton–style guns perfected by the Englishmen Philippe–Coles and Burley, the Frenchman Furcy, and the Italian Landi; they're equipped with a special system of airtight fastenings and can fire in underwater conditions. But I repeat: having no gunpowder, I've replaced it with air at high pressure, which is abundantly supplied me by the Nautilus's pumps.""

""But this air must be swiftly depleted.""

""Well, in a pinch can't my Rouquayrol tank supply me with more? All I have to do is draw it from an ad hoc spigot. Besides, Professor Aronnax, you'll see for yourself that during these underwater hunting trips, we make no great expenditure of either air or bullets.""

""But it seems to me that in this semidarkness, amid this liquid that's so dense in comparison to the atmosphere, a gunshot couldn't carry far and would prove fatal only with difficulty!""

""On the contrary, sir, with this rifle every shot is fatal; and as soon as the animal is hit, no matter how lightly, it falls as if struck by lightning.""

""Why?""

""Because this rifle doesn't shoot ordinary bullets but little glass capsules invented by the Austrian chemist Leniebroek, and I have a considerable supply of them. These glass capsules are covered with a strip of steel and weighted with a lead base; they're genuine little Leyden jars charged with high–voltage electricity. They go off at the slightest impact, and the animal, no matter how strong, drops dead. I might add that these capsules are no bigger than number 4 shot, and the chamber of any ordinary rifle could hold ten of them.""

""I'll quit debating,"" I replied, getting up from the table. ""And all that's left is for me to shoulder my rifle. So where you go, I'll go.""

Captain Nemo led me to the Nautilus's stern, and passing by Ned and Conseil's cabin, I summoned my two companions, who instantly followed us.

Then we arrived at a cell located within easy access of the engine room; in this cell we were to get dressed for our stroll."

Scientists,Naysayer,pop,"Thank you.  (Applause.)  Hello, Anteaters!  (Applause.)  That is something I never thought I’d say.  (Laughter.)  Please, please take a seat.

To President Napolitano -- which is a nice step up from Secretary; to Fred Ruiz, Vice Chair of the University of California Regents; Chancellor Drake; Representatives Loretta Sanchez and Alan Lowenthal; to the trustees and faculty -- thank you for this honor.  And congratulations to the Class of 2014!  (Applause.)

Now, let me begin my saying all of you had the inside track in getting me here -- because my personal assistant, Ferial, is a proud Anteater.  (Applause.)  Until today, I did not understand why she greets me every morning by shouting “Zot, Zot, Zot!”  (Laughter.)  It’s been a little weird.  But she explained it to me on the way here this morning, because she’s very proud to see her brother, Sina, graduate today as well.  (Applause.)  So, graduates, obviously we’re proud of you, but let’s give it up for your proud family and friends and professors, because this is their day, too.  (Applause.)

And even though he’s on the road this weekend, I also want to thank Angels centerfielder Mike Trout for letting me cover his turf for a while.  (Applause.)  He actually signed a bat for me, which is part of my retirement plan.  (Laughter.)  I will be keeping that.  And this is a very cool place to hold a commencement.  I know that UC Irvine’s baseball team opens College World Series play in Omaha right about now -- (applause) -- so let’s get this speech underway.  If the hot dog guy comes by, get me one.  (Laughter.)

Now, in additional to Ferial, graduates, I’m here for a simple reason:  You asked.  For those who don’t know, the UC Irvine community sent 10,000 postcards to the White House asking me to come speak today.  (Applause.)  Some tried to guilt me into coming.  I got one that said, “I went to your first inauguration, can you please come to my graduation?”  (Applause.)  Some tried bribery:  “I’ll support the Chicago Bulls.”  Another said today would be your birthday -- so happy birthday, whoever you are.

My personal favorite -- somebody wrote and said, “We are super underrated!”  (Laughter.)  I’m sure she was talking about this school.  But keep in mind, you’re not only the number-one university in America younger than 50 years old, you also hold the Guinness World Record for biggest water pistol fight.  (Applause.)  You’re pretty excited about that.  (Laughter.)

“We are super underrated.”  This young lady could have just as well been talking, though, about this generation.  I think this generation of young people is super underrated.

In your young lives, you’ve seen dizzying change, from terror attacks to economic turmoil; from Twitter to Tumblr.  Some of your families have known tough times during the course of the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression.  You’re graduating into a still-healing job market, and some of you are carrying student loan debt that you’re concerned about.  And yet, your generation -- the most educated, the most diverse, the most tolerant, the most politically independent and the most digitally fluent in our history -- is also on record as being the most optimistic about our future.

And I’m here to tell you that you are right to be optimistic.  (Applause.)  You are right to be optimistic.  Consider this:  Since the time most of you graduated from high school, fewer Americans are at war.  More have health insurance.  More are graduating from college.  Our businesses have added more than 9 million new jobs.  The number of states where you’re free to marry who you love has more than doubled.  (Applause.) And that’s just some of the progress that you’ve seen while you’ve been studying here at UC Irvine.

But we do face real challenges:  Rebuilding the middle class and reversing inequality’s rise.  Reining in college costs.  Protecting voting rights.  Welcoming the immigrants and young dreamers who keep this country vibrant.  Stemming the tide of violence that guns inflict on our schools.  We’ve got some big challenges.  And if you’re fed a steady diet of cynicism that says nobody is trustworthy and nothing works, and there’s no way we can actually address these problems, then the temptation is too just go it alone, to look after yourself and not participate in the larger project of achieving our best vision of America.

And I’m here to tell you, don’t believe the cynicism.  Guard against it.  Don’t buy into it.  Today, I want to use one case study to show you that progress is possible and perseverance is critical.  I want to show you how badly we need you -- both your individual voices and your collective efforts -- to give you the chance you seek to change the world, and maybe even save it.

I’m going to talk about one of the most significant long-term challenges that our country and our planet faces:  the growing threat of a rapidly changing climate.

Now, this isn’t a policy speech.  I understand it’s a commencement, and I already delivered a long climate address last summer.  I remember because it was 95 degrees and my staff had me do it outside, and I was pouring with sweat -- as a visual aid.  (Laughter.)  And since this is a very educated group, you already know the science.  Burning fossil fuels release carbon dioxide.  Carbon dioxide traps heat.  Levels of carbon dioxide in our atmosphere are higher than they’ve been in 800,000 years.
We know the trends.  The 18 warmest years on record have all happened since you graduates were born.  We know what we see with our own eyes.  Out West, firefighters brave longer, harsher wildfire seasons; states have to budget for that.  Mountain towns worry about what smaller snowpacks mean for tourism.  Farmers and families at the bottom worry about what it will mean for their water.  In cities like Norfolk and Miami, streets now flood frequently at high tide.  Shrinking icecaps have National Geographic making the biggest change in its atlas since the Soviet Union broke apart.

So the question is not whether we need to act.  The overwhelming judgment of science, accumulated and measured and reviewed over decades, has put that question to rest.  The question is whether we have the will to act before it’s too late.  For if we fail to protect the world we leave not just to my children, but to your children and your children’s children, we will fail one of our primary reasons for being on this world in the first place.  And that is to leave the world a little bit better for the next generation.

Now, the good is you already know all this.  UC Irvine set up the first Earth System Science Department in America.  (Applause.)  A UC Irvine professor-student team won the Nobel Prize for discovering that CFCs destroy the ozone layer.  (Applause.)  A UC Irvine glaciologist’s work led to one of last month’s report showing one of the world’s major ice sheets in irreversible retreat.  Students and professors are in the field working to predict changing weather patterns, fire seasons, and water tables -- working to understand how shifting seasons affect global ecosystems; to get zero-emission vehicles on the road faster; to help coastal communities adapt to rising seas.  And when I challenge colleges to reduce their energy use to 20 percent by 2020, UC Irvine went ahead and did it last year.  Done.  (Applause.)  So UC Irvine is ahead of the curve.  All of you are ahead of the curve.

Your generation reminds me of something President Wilson once said.  He said, “Sometimes people call me an idealist.  Well, that is the way I know I am an American.”  That’s who we are.

And if you need a reason to be optimistic about our future, then look around this stadium.  Because today, in America, the largest single age group is 22 years ago.  And you are going to do great things.  And I want you to know that I’ve got your back -- because one of the reasons I ran for this office was because I believed our dangerous addiction to foreign oil left our economy at risk and our planet in peril.  So when I took office, we set out to use more clean energy and less dirty energy, and waste less energy overall.

And since then, we’ve doubled the distance our cars will go on a gallon of gas by the middle of the next decade.  We’ve tripled the electricity we harness from the wind, generating enough last year to power every home in California.  We’ve multiplied the electricity we generate from the sun 10 times over.  And this state, California, is so far ahead of the rest of the country in solar, that earlier this year solar power met 18 percent of your total power demand one day.  (Applause.)

The bottom line is, America produces more renewable energy than ever, more natural gas than anyone.  And for the first time in nearly two decades, we produce more oil here at home than we buy from other countries.  And these advances have created jobs and grown our economy, and helped cut our carbon pollution to levels not seen in about 20 years.  Since 2006, no country on Earth has reduced its total carbon pollution by as much as the United States of America.  (Applause.)

So that’s all reason for optimism.  Here’s the challenge:  We’ve got to do more.  What we’re doing is not enough.  And that’s why, a couple weeks ago, America proposed new standards to limit the amount of harmful carbon pollution that power plants can dump into the air.  And we also have to realize, as hundreds of scientists declared last month, that climate change is no longer a distant threat, but “has moved firmly into the present.”  That’s a quote.  In some parts of the country, weather-related disasters like droughts, and fires, and storms, and floods are going to get harsher and they’re going to get costlier.  And that’s why, today, I’m announcing a new $1 billion competitive fund to help communities prepare for the impacts of climate change and build more resilient infrastructure across the country.  (Applause.)

So it’s a big problem.  But progress, no matter how big the problem, is possible.  That’s important to remember.  Because no matter what you do in life, you’re going to run up against big problems -- in your own personal life and in your communities and in your country.   There’s going to be a stubborn status quo, and there are going to be people determined to stymie your efforts to bring about change.  There are going to be people who say you can’t do something.  There are going to be people who say you shouldn’t bother.  I’ve got some experience in this myself.  (Laughter.)

Now, part of what’s unique about climate change, though, is the nature of some of the opposition to action.  It’s pretty rare that you’ll encounter somebody who says the problem you’re trying to solve simply doesn’t exist.  When President Kennedy set us on a course for the moon, there were a number of people who made a serious case that it wouldn’t be worth it; it was going to be too expensive, it was going to be too hard, it would take too long.  But nobody ignored the science.  I don’t remember anybody saying that the moon wasn’t there or that it was made of cheese.  (Laughter.)

And today’s Congress, though, is full of folks who stubbornly and automatically reject the scientific evidence about climate change.  They will tell you it is a hoax, or a fad.  One member of Congress actually says the world is cooling.  There was one member of Congress who mentioned a theory involving “dinosaur flatulence” -- which I won’t get into.  (Laughter.)

Now, their view may be wrong -- and a fairly serious threat to everybody’s future -- but at least they have the brass to say what they actually think.  There are some who also duck the question.  They say -- when they’re asked about climate change, they say, “Hey, look, I’m not a scientist.”  And I’ll translate that for you.  What that really means is, “I know that manmade climate change really is happening, but if I admit it, I’ll be run out of town by a radical fringe that thinks climate science is a liberal plot, so I’m not going to admit it.”  (Applause.)

Now, I’m not a scientist either, but we’ve got some really good ones at NASA.  I do know that the overwhelming majority of scientists who work on climate change, including some who once disputed the data, have put that debate to rest.  The writer, Thomas Friedman, recently put it to me this way.  He were talking, and he says, “Your kid is sick, you consult 100 doctors; 97 of them tell you to do this, three tell  to do that, and you want to go with the three?”
The fact is, this should not be a partisan issue.  After all, it was Republicans who used to lead the way on new ideas to protect our environment.  It was Teddy Roosevelt who first pushed for our magnificent national parks.  It was Richard Nixon who signed the Clean Air Act and opened the EPA.  George H.W. Bush -- a wonderful man who at 90 just jumped out of a plane in a parachute -- (laughter) -- said that “human activities are changing the atmosphere in unexpected and unprecedented ways.”  John McCain and other Republicans publicly supported free market-based cap-and-trade bills to slow carbon pollution just a few years ago -- before the Tea Party decided it was a massive threat to freedom and liberty.

These days, unfortunately, nothing is happening.  Even minor energy efficiency bills are killed on the Senate floor.  And the reason is because people are thinking about politics instead of thinking about what’s good for the next generation.  What’s the point of public office if you’re not going to use your power to help solve problems?  (Applause.)

And part of the challenge is that the media doesn’t spend a lot of time covering climate change and letting average Americans know how it could impact our future.  Now, the broadcast networks’ nightly newscasts spend just a few minutes a month covering climate issues.  On cable, the debate is usually between political pundits, not scientists.  When we introduced those new anti-pollution standards a couple weeks ago, the instant reaction from the Washington’s political press wasn’t about what it would mean for our planet; it was what would it mean for an election six months from now.  And that kind of misses the point.  Of course, they’re not scientists, either.

And I want to tell you all this not to discourage you.  I’m telling you all this because I want to light a fire under you.  As the generation getting shortchanged by inaction on this issue, I want all of you to understand you cannot accept that this is the way it has to be.

The climate change deniers suggest there’s still a debate over the science.  There is not.  The talking heads on cable news suggest public opinion is hopelessly deadlocked.  It is not.  Seven in ten Americans say global warming is a serious problem.  Seven in ten say the federal government should limit pollution from our power plants.  And of all the issues in a recent poll asking Americans where we think we can make a difference, protecting the environment came out on top.  (Applause.)

So we’ve got public opinion potentially on our side.  We can do this.  We can make a difference.  You can make a difference.  And the sooner you do, the better -- not just for our climate, but for our economy.  There’s a reason that more than 700 businesses like Apple and Microsoft, and GM and Nike, Intel, Starbucks have declared that “tackling climate change is one of America’s greatest economic opportunities in the 21st century.”  The country that seizes this opportunity first will lead the way.  A low-carbon, clean energy economy can be an engine for growth and jobs for decades to come, and I want America to build that engine.  Because if we do, others will follow.  I want those jobs; I want those opportunities; I want those businesses right here in the United States of America.  (Applause.)

Developing countries are using more and more energy, and tens of millions of people are entering the global middle class, and they want to buy cars and refrigerators.  So if we don’t deal with this problem soon, we’re going to be overwhelmed.  These nations have some of the fastest-rising levels of carbon pollution.  They’re going to have to take action to meet this challenge.  They’re more vulnerable to the effects of climate change than we are.  They’ve got even more to lose.  But they’re waiting to see what does America do.  That’s what the world does.  It waits to watch us act.  And when we do, they move.  And I’m convinced that on this issue, when America proves what’s possible, then they’re going to join us.

And America cannot meet this threat alone.  Of course, the world cannot meet it without America.  This is a fight that America must lead.  So I’m going to keep doing my part for as long as I hold this office and as long as I’m a citizen once out of office.  But we’re going to need you, the next generation, to finish the job.

We need scientists to design new fuels.  We need farmers to help grow them.  We need engineers to invent new technologies.  We need entrepreneurs to sell those technologies.  (Applause.)  We need workers to operate assembly lines that hum with high-tech, zero-carbon components.  We need builders to hammer into place the foundations for a clean energy age.  We need diplomats and businessmen and women, and Peace Corps volunteers to help developing nations skip past the dirty phase of development and transition to sustainable sources of energy.

In other words, we need you.  (Applause.)  We need you.  And if you believe, like I do, that something has to be done on this, then you’re going to have to speak out.  You’re going to have to learn more about these issues.  Even if you’re not like Jessica and an expert, you’re going to have to work on this.  You’re going to have to push those of us in power to do what this American moment demands.  You’ve got to educate your classmates, and colleagues, and family members and fellow citizens, and tell them what’s at stake.  You’ve got to push back against the misinformation, and speak out for facts, and organize others around your vision for the future.

You need to invest in what helps, and divest from what harms.  And you’ve got to remind everyone who represents you, at every level of government, that doing something about climate change is a prerequisite for your vote.

It’s no accident that when President Kennedy needed to convince the nation that sending Americans into space was a worthy goal, he went to a university.  That’s where he started.  Because a challenge as big as that, as costly as that, as difficult as that, requires a spirit of youth.  It requires a spirit of adventure; a willingness to take risks.  It requires optimism.  It requires hope.  That day, a man told us we’d go to the moon within a decade.  And despite all the naysayers, somehow we knew as a nation that we’d build a spaceship and we’d meet that goal.

That’s because we’re Americans -- and that’s what we do.  Even when our political system is consumed by small things, we are a people called to do big things.  And progress on climate change is a big thing.  Progress won’t always be flashy; it will be measured in disasters averted, and lives saved, and a planet preserved -- and days just like this one, 20 years from now, and 50 years from now, and 100 years from now.  But can you imagine a more worthy goal -- a more worthy legacy -- than protecting the world we leave to our children?
So I ask your generation to help leave us that legacy.  I ask you to believe in yourselves and in one another, and above all, when life gets you down or somebody tells you you can’t do something, to believe in something better.

There are people here who know what it means to dream.  When Mohamad Abedi was a boy, the suffering he saw in refugee camps in Lebanon didn’t drive him into despair -- it inspired him to become a doctor.  And when he came to America, he discovered a passion for engineering.  So here, at UC Irvine, he became a biomedical engineer to study the human brain.  (Applause.)  And Mohamad said, “Had I never come to the United States, I would have never had the ability to do the work that I’m doing.”  He’s now going to CalTech to keep doing that work.

Cinthia Flores is the daughter of a single mom who worked as a seamstress and a housekeeper.  (Applause.)  The first in her family to graduate from high school.  The first in her family to graduate from college.  And in college, she says, “I learned about myself that I was good at advocating for others, and that I was argumentative -- so maybe I should go to law school.”  And, today, Cinthia is now the first in her family to graduate from law school.  And she plans to advocate for the rights of workers like her mom.  (Applause.)  She says, “I have the great privilege and opportunity to answer the call of my community.”  “The bottom line,” she says, “is being of service.”



On 9/11, Aaron Anderson was a sophomore in college.  Several months later, he was in training for Army Special Forces.  He fought in Afghanistan, and on February 28th, 2006, he was nearly killed by an IED.  He endured dozens of surgeries to save his legs, months of recovery at Walter Reed.  When he couldn’t physically return to active duty, he devoted his time to his brothers in arms, starting two businesses with fellow veterans, and a foundation to help fellow wounded Green Beret soldiers.  And then he went back to school.  And last December, he graduated summa cum laude from UC Irvine.  And Aaron is here today, along with four soon-to-be commissioned ROTC cadets, and 65 other graduating veterans.  And I would ask them to stand and be recognized for their service.  (Applause.)

The point is, you know how to dream.  And you know how to work for your dreams.  And, yes, sometimes you may be “super underrated.”  But usually it’s the underrated, the underdogs, the dreamers, the idealists, the fighters, the argumentative -- those are the folks who do the biggest things.

And this generation -- this 9/11 generation of soldiers; this new generation of scientists and advocates and entrepreneurs and altruists -- you’re the antidote to cynicism.  It doesn’t mean you’re not going to get down sometimes.  You will.  You’ll know disillusionment.  You’ll experience doubt.  People will disappoint you by their actions.  But that can’t discourage you.

Cynicism has never won a war, or cured a disease, or started a business, or fed a young mind, or sent men into space.  Cynicism is a choice.  Hope is a better choice.  (Applause.)

Hope is what gave young soldiers the courage to storm a beach and liberate people they never met.

Hope is what gave young students the strength to sit in and stand up and march for women’s rights, and civil rights, and voting rights, and gay rights, and immigration rights.

Hope is the belief, against all evidence to the contrary, that there are better days ahead, and that together we can build up a middle class, and reshape our immigration system, and shield our children from gun violence, and shelter future generations from the ravages of climate change.

Hope is the fact that, today, the single largest age group in America is 22 years old who are all just itching to reshape this country and reshape the world.  And I cannot wait to see what you do tomorrow.

Congratulations.  (Applause.)  Thank you, Class of 2014.   God bless you.  God bless the United States of America.  (Applause.)"

Or how it feels to fall behind
And watch you call his name

Can't keep this beating heart at bay
Set my midnight sorrow free
I will give you all of me
Just leave your lover, leave him for me
Leave your lover, leave him for me

One more night, one more show
On the plane, that's the game
One more city, for the fame
Up early, plane is late
Wait for hours at the gate
Middle seat, I can't sleep
Crushed by men with large physique

All I want for me today is:
Swedish models and cocaine

Flight is rough, had enough
I could use some vodka love
Someone snores! Where's the Lord?
One more hour to unboard
Get stopped by the cops
Searching for those rockstar drops
Outta luck, I get bossed
At the belt, my luggage lost

Where's the driver, grab a cab
To the hotel, time to nap
10pm to the club, got no sleep
So fucked up!

Tag the walls with sharpie-ink

I drew a map of Canada
Oh Canada
With your face sketched on it twice
Oh you're in my blood like holy wine
You taste so bitter and so sweet

Oh I could drink a case of you darling
Still I'd be on my feet
Oh I would still be on my feet

Oh I am a lonely painter
I live in a box of paints
I'm frightened by the devil
And I'm drawn to those ones that ain't afraid

I remember that time you told me you said

Surely you touched mine
'Cause part of you pours out of me
In these lines from time to time

So I kill a pussy, I murder shit, homicide on shorty
My gold Role cost 60 racks, my rose gold cost 40

Shake Some Action!,Draw the Line,pop,"Till death do us part, Ave
This is something we can't make wait
You see, it's just like you with these toy guns
We got a fake Drake
(No disrespect, my brother.)
It's 'bout time somebody finally put me face-to-face with this—what, nigga?
If you see a bitch, you slap a bitch when you see one, nigga
I ain't never been a bitch and today ain't finna be the day I'ma be one, nigga
Fuck these punchline niggas
Every line: gun, squeeze triggers
Ayy, Smack! What's happenin'?
Ain't you tireda the same show?
All this poppin' with the straps from these re-run niggas?
Wе know what he sung, nigga
""Oh, that Top Tier diss? I had the bеst verse on that rap song!
Oh, I can't get no matches, Smack. I just keep gettin' passed on.""
We hear ya, Ave! We feel ya, nigga; that's wrong
You deserve a huge battle! Somethin' that sounded big!
Now, you in here wit' a gorilla, gettin' blacked on!
Won't last long
You claim you mastered the game but can't level up
You afraid to act ya age 'cause when you rap on stage, the content would have to be better, huh?
So instead, it's just the young shit: you sellin' bricks, the Beretta bust
""But Dot, Dot, Dot!"" Et cetera, et cetera
You ain't no live nigga! You dead to us!
You no competitor!
Old-ass nigga actin' young for the bitches
Yeah, well, a shark is the oldest predator!
I'm better, bruh
Why envy me?
We both old in this game but it ain't the same
You need the crutches; I'm on my own two feet
You joined EFB? Yeah, to make the news
Now, you gettin' coverage from NBC
And what we gon' see?
Every event, you gon' follow the Crips?
Well, that's type strange
He gon' be in every scene, chasin' the Nuts
Makes sense since you around I.C.E. age
Quite lame!
You was talkin' to Wolf like he was too old for the pill-poppin'
The pipe raise
That was fresh, man, but when he was in the tenth
You was right behind him in the ninth grade!
Dawg buggin'
Y'all love him
Birthed in this game old; now, he all youngin?
On nothin'
Don't mind me if I benj a man up
I'm just pushin' y'all button
Dawg frontin'
Bitch-ass niggas on Live wit' caps
My name in they mouth but not in they raps 'cause they bitch-made
I'll beat you niggas up—quick fade!
Who the fuck you think you talkin' to?
Blood, I'll sock you dead in yo' ribcage!
Where that bitch Tay? (Ayy,  homie !)
After you get yo' shit caved!
Pacoima, nigga! With the Pirus, I been raised
Wanted to hit the streets at a kid's age
They tellin' me, ""Chill, young Blood! Shit, you only in the sixth grade!""
Smack, I couldn't wait to leave my small room, hit the streets, and perform on a big stage
Shit's changed
We grew up squabblin'
Watchin' big homies throw bullets out the old Eagle like Donovan
Till a nigga my age snitched on the same homies we was mobbin' wit'
He got on that stage and told on all of 'em
Waitin' on a verdict was the only time I was afraid of a large audience
What you hollerin'?
New era? Nigga, you way too old; don't waste yo' soul
You prolly thought Hov's 4:44 was about fo' .44s but no, no, no
See, when you hit a certain age, you gotta show the growth
You wanna be TBE? You can't keep punchin', nigga!
You gotta show da role! I know, I know!
It's just battle rap—right?—so it's just for fun
But you claim you put in work so we gotta ask what shit you done
""Oh, my name Ave so I'ma hit the Ave again and lift a gun.""
Fake smoke! You never hit it once!
In spite-a that, you wouldn't double back on nothin' but a sticka gum
Okay, that double meant it's a webba lies if he spun!
What shit you done
Besides let go-a ya morals and get in battle rap to grip a gun?
If you really did shit in the past, you would be tryna change the future
In the present—that's how you gift to young!
Instead, you sung songs to the youth 'bout how to ship a ton
Just to have kids to hang witchu, speakin' they language
It's snake shit how you split ya tongue
What shit you done? We gots to ask him
What? Lane-changin'? Road-ragin' like that shit is fun?
Yeah, you gettin' drunk
But all that drive gon' fuck around and hit me and it's a hit-and-run
What shit you done? We gots to ask him
All this yellin' 'bout the TECs; lotsa cappin'
Where's the talk about buyin' gold as currency and not for fashion?
""Well, Dot, you flip-flopped.
It's either Piru shit or it's prophet-rappin'.""
No, this is a marathon; this race is about profit-stackin'
We learnt crypto from a Crip, though
Nipsey taught without that victory, we not gon' lap them
Where's ya grown man talk? Huh? It's just not gon' happen?
All these bars about you raisin' a handle
What about stocks that's crashin'?
See, here's where we draw the line
You over 40 actin' under 30—improper fraction!
Stop the actin'!
I mean, you came out the Cave and started feedin' ya hunger
It's like that Netflix show Midnight Mass
Whatever you drinkin', Blood, got you thinkin' you younger
And what spell are y'all under?
""I don't know, B Dot. Ave come with the punches.""
Yeah, but they all fake
Fat Blood ain't gon' raise nothin' but his heart rate
Where y'all got this mark ranked?
If it's over me, I'll give him the business...
And then we'll see the Shark tank!
Dawg fake!
If I get to the point, you'll meet a shark fate
Get stabbed wit' a knife I got offa 
My redemption:  shank
This the God, Nate!
""Oh, my name Ave so I gotta rap about the ave to make it match too.""
Bitch nigga, we ain't ask you!
It ain't the fact that you rap like you half ya age because you have to
It's that you happy to do that garbage
It's even more trash when the nigga glad to!
That's why I'm at you!

Yes!
It's 'bout time somebody finally put me face-to-face with this bitch
See, this was one that the fans want
But lemme say some quick 'cause I done had enougha y'all
How you gon' love a drunk Ave but mad when I got to every fuckin' bar?
What's the problem?
'Cause I done put in work for this 
Been consistent wit' every verse
Shit, I deserve to be cocky
Plus, I'm grown
If you that hurt, shit, don't watch me
And that's why you gon' adress me as sir, Charles
And that's word on these Barkleys!
Nigga, you copy?
If we ain't got problems, let's leave it there
Mark my words: I'll put hands on Dot—we readin' braille!
Bitch, I'm in the streets as well!
Nigga, who afraid of bangers?
You don't know me, kid; I done made it through stranger danger
So look, gangsta
I don't care about ya angles or ya preachin'
My question is, ""Are we beefin'?""
If some  probably sneakin'
Try to sneak me off the set and we shootin'
And anybody can join Dot and I don't mean like how Rex be recruitin'
So don't be stupid
'Cause I'm one-a the dudes that respect ya movement
And reflect on how the ghettos affected wit' less improvement
But the threats, I'm never cool wit'
I'll shoot this large shotty that'll prolly list five percenta the God body
Nigga, try me!
I'm outside, B
My stripes earned
Hood starts to book smarts; all my lessons in life learned
We was weighin' up and bought lead hammers
He just seen shit when it came to the porch; youse a doorbell camera
So where's ya manners?
This image you portray for these dudes prolly fool maybe a few
I mean, he say he a goon but that's these other rules blazin' they tools
Shit is not yo' glizzy to pop corn—boy, you stadium food!
Is dude a activist or a gang-banger tryna be active-ish
That act as if it's action inside them raps that he cappin' wit'?
'Cause I will get this bitch beat up
Or lay Charlie with the fifty—at least you can wish me luck!
Don't give a shit what set you claimin'
My hitters set they payment
I'll put figures on Rooftop like Christmas decoration
Can't find yo' location?
Call Caps 'cause he on ya
Or I just get a two for twenty like a Applebee's order
That's how we board up
See, you gon' complain about who I'm wit'
How I move don't affect or help you—get off my dick!
Nigga sick I'm with the team lowkey
Well, go to the roof wit' ya principle
They still gon' choose to lean on me
'Cause I'm a beast and ain't shit sweet neither; believe it
We can throw it up right after the plate; keep it bulimic
Man, it's easy how I whoop on this goof
He start war—parkour; I'm on a run after I flip on the Roof
What, you need proof?
'Cause, bitch, you know I been 'bout that action
Thirty under the forty—that's that improper fraction
Wait, I ain't gotta clap; I got savages that'll shoot
I give a order, the baby by ya daughter—what battle truth?
Lil nigga, you rattle who? Nobody that's wit' my team
You better scatter! You can have all that chatter and bitch, I swing
This battle can get y'all lean
So if I was you, man, I'd tell this African bitch, ""Bounce wit' that bark.""
Like Prince Akeem!
Fuck you mean? It ain't just you that's movin' wit' hitters
I got shooters in my platoon prolly cool wit' y'all niggas
So involvin' the wrong dude a dilemma
'Cause as soon as a body drop, it's on Dot like you losin' at Twister
You view the picture?
For those that think Ave be up here bluffin', nigga, trust me
You can get ya bitch ass beat up for nothin'
And I ain't 'bout to fuss wit' no nigga either; the shoutin' 
So when Rooftop shot, y'all gon' think we brought out the drones
Bitch, I'm grown!
And try to play me just 'cause you home
All it takes to have my goons in the place is liftin' the phone
And y'all gon' see how the crew do
No Gs ride witchu few
We all know B's side pussy
Just call it Nunu
Do you!

You think you top tier now 'cause you fuckin' wit' Geech?
Oh, you the franchise? Are you dumb? Was it Rum
Or did JC turn water to wine and give you somethin' to drink?
Ayy, Gotti! You on point, God, the way you runnin' the plays
And got a nigga like Nate under ya league
What a hustle! Told him, ""It'll be magic if you come to the West.
You should kill niggas. I got whatchu need.""
But failed to explain no matter how many people you thirty too
He still number one on the team
Penny for ya thoughts!
(Come on, man!)
I just listed off the squad—aww, but I forgot Brandon!
Damn it! I gotta redeem
Wait, wait, wait; didn't I say Nate?
So that means I had a real name up in the scheme
Wake up from this dream!
You got casted as a extra just for Geechi to stay in the league
'Cause when it's lights, camera, action
Geechi and Rum ain't puttin' you up in the scene
Joinin' EFB watered down what you built and here's what I mean
It's like the lost streets of Atlantis
How Ave is always gon' be under the Cs!
Come up! Can you breathe?
You'll ride any nigga wave to stay afloat in this league
I mean, you movin' from side to side
That ain't the two steps that go with this thing
You fuckin' up the dance
Followin' other niggas' moves like you don't know the routine
Why go through this, king?
Niggas playin' witcha character on story mode, controllin' the scene
What good is havin' a voice in a group where only the lead vocalist sings?
Y'all notice this theme?
It's not for pride
We liked you better on ya own, nigga; not gon' lie
We didn't even notice ya career was resurrected till ya left the Cave and pushed Roc aside
Ah, there's my guy!
From 2016, that battle, Nitty
No niggas wit' him!
No hypemen; not even Gwitty
No funny characters; just one nigga in the hood and that was Kenny
But now you the junior in the Mafia—? Never mind; it's not a biggie!
I just don't get him!
Grown-ass nigga joinin' crews, huh?
Fuck a battle rap clique, nigga—this rules, bruh!
Two Ps and one B; this the sign where my rules from
This can go either way but ain't shit debatable when my niggas chuckin' up the two-one
These dudes dumb!
I don't need a big entourage with the hype and gimmicks
Besides, I'd rather have my back against the wall
Then a nigga can't knife me in it!
Can you cite the difference?
When we see you on ya own, you one-a the nicest niggas
Soon as you get into one-a these groups that already got a Mike, you Pippen
When you was with the Bat, man, you was side-kickin'
They was robbin' you blind
You couldn't see at the time but ya man was the eye witness
Had to calm this joker down with the Ritalin
Told him he'll reach new heights and take flight!
Then, it was penguin steps, barely movin' inches
Was in the trenches
In the Cave with the Al-Qaeda on the line
Discussin' the crime business
They kept sayin' they was gon' blow up the Ave
False flag; I think yo bomb's still got the time tickin'
This is divine livin'
A 36-year-old that been through shit and dodged prison
I could never follow the leada niggas younger than me still with the .9 liftin'
In the landa the blind, the man with the third eye defines wisdom
They come press me and find a diamond
I'm one-a the coldest niggas; my mind different
This guy's trippin'
That's why I know you never been through shit
'Cause every punchline, it's the Ruger spit
The toolie grip
Or construction work: you move a brick
You supposed to look down at the niggas doin' what you've done
Instead, you look up to the niggas that's still doin' it
You goofy bitch!
(What the fuck?)
Dissin' my nigga Murda Mook and shit
That's a vet, respected
You bitch-ass new era niggas ain't no threats to legends
You ain't got enough  in the game to shake up in the race when he done already etched and sketched in
Youse a fifth-year senior hangin' out wit' freshmen
You was the Cave yes-man
You still got guano on ya face
How that Bat shit taste, pet detective?
I do not respect this!
Smack, lemme ask this question
You tell me how it seems
Don't you think a nigga that'll jump from team to team would also jump from league to league?
I mean, you built up the Ave, give him a road to success
He used that same path to leave
I mean, you made him rare, grew you a breed... gave him ya faith!
Just to see him on stage wit' a nigga sayin', ""Do you believe?""
This nigga's a yee!
Jumpin' from clique to clique; you not a boss for that
Gettin' put on anybody hood; niggas get offed for that
I'ma be on yo' head like a Boston cap
How ironic! I'm tryna keep my niggas off the streets and my niggas tryna keep me up offa Ave!
This nigga's trash!

I'm only up here witchu 'cause these other legends that you love to praise pussy
Yeah, I said it! Nigga, one thing about it: they can't whoop me
Y'all know this should be so-and-so spot but he fake type
So they told me, ""Punch on the Elevator."" I'm Ray Rice
But I ain't mad at this match or hatin'
I get to snap to a runnin' back? Yeah, we in wildcat formation
Ol' boy thinkin' he exposin' some secrets
Oh, he can keep it! No cappin'
Nigga, closed claptions: watch what you speakin'
You gon' preach about the Cave today?
Say Ave was made by Roc and the only way I got drive 'cause he paved the way?
Man, okay
I know there's some shit that y'all love to mention
But fuck who need convincin' if me and Tay ain't got tension
I ain't askin' y'all to switch to my view
Just understand I'll still swing over Roc like I'm Skip to My Lou
You come for them, that mean you fuckin' wit' me
You don't think I treasure Chess? What it's gon' take? Until you under the sea?
See, we stick to them 
Give a shit 'bout who sold you
Them my bros
Plus it's a lotta other shit that I go through
Kids, bills, crazy bitches, some mo'—!
Nigga, trust me: wit' Ave, you ain't gotta ask—bitch nigga, I told you!
Expose who?
You don't know me well enough to be judgin'
Career-wise, takin' you don't help my status or nothin'
So cut the shit before you start this façade
Like I had to find dry from the Elevator like a parkin' garage
Man, on God!
I got millions of views, seen all the stages
Battles of the year, impact with the rawest phrases
See, that's why they gon' choose big fella
And I made all that look hella easy with a ruthless record
What could you tell us?
I mean, you might be slick witcha writin'
But see, ya impact ain't shit that's excitin'
Gotti, Rum, Lyt, Diz who they hypin'
You might help the Left Side be a strong side but they only remember the Titans and you ain't like them!
It's like you just here for some quick fame
Doin' all these preachin' but barely eatin'—that shit lame!
I'm in this bitch to get change
So nigga, you can cut out this image or die with that broke shit like Squid Games
Don't be 'shamed; face the truth
Them stages is the loot, Uncle Luke
What you think was gon' bring a raise? The roof?
Youse a goof!
But you got the nerve to judge niggas' lives—okay, fam
I'll tell you how I blow my money sometime
I took bread from the Jey check, went and got some mo' change
The Ice check? Gun connect; I had to cop some mo' thangs
The Sikh guap bought my partner cocaine
Now, I'ma add up Dot's for another house like a dominoes game
We ain't the same!
, I dare you to try me
And they gon' read about Charles Burnely
I mean like, ""Charles barely survivin'!""
'Cause if he fire, dawg can't miss
'Cause once we on the Elevator, boy, it's up and it's stuck
Call maintenance or we'll exchange fists
Getcha tooth work gone
Or back-to-back slams till he got a few hurt bones
'Cause I'm official with the scoop work, homes
Y'all gon' see Dot on his head and Dot on his che—I sound like Mook vers' Jones!
The fuck you on?
You fake-ass prophet that get it poppin'
Rockin' beads, flags, durags, kufis—goofy, just stop it!
We can tell fraud already
Oh, he got a method wit' knowledge behind bars?
So did the jail call in Bellies
Like, what the fuck could you tell me?
Trust me, this ain't no pressure
Battle-wise, ya status not as high; save all the lectures
'Cause really, ya stock sucks
Plus he ain't bringin' nothin' to the table for his name to be pulled from the potlucks
I mean, your Top Tier verse really sucked; shit was the worst
Had the nerve to follow me on the song; shoulda went first
Sorry, fella, ayy, ya blew it
But listenin' to dude tryna get to the flow done made us hate the Elevator music
All you provin' is ya envy
Blowin' all this fuckin' smoke 'cause you attached to the roof
Fuck, you a chimney?
That energy don't rattle me none
Give a fuck if you skip the PGs; you still hold the value-a one
What has he done?
Like, honestly, son
The people askin'
And we done seen ya contract, Dot
No need for braggin'
But you bash what we do for the skrilla
But you keep jump on these stages while gettin' paid less than Crucible niggas?
Oh, you just bitter!
Wait, I know the problem: it's too much Twitter
See, these fans got you gassed; now, you act as if you that nigga
But see, he done missed the plot
'Cause now the Wolf gon' get his spot
And they gon' add the ice cream right after they dip in Dots
Nigga, what?


Ayy, Ave, we don't look at life the same and that's okay
I'm here to give you the lens so you can see how they live
They been impairin' ya visuals
I'm tryna take you on a walk, man, so you can understand how bein' radio silent when it come to these issues is critical
The shit you been transmittin'? Pitiful
Low-frequency programmin'; the playlist ain't that original
I mean, you fat, black, unhealthy, promotin' guns and drugs
Everything comin' out this speaker's stereotypical
But it's y'all individuals
Who sit at home, givin' props, applaudin' the rituals
See, it's an exercise on ya mind; it's all designed to condition you
Look at the food that they givin' you
Massa gave you scraps that you turned into dinner too
And then you turn on the TV to see a live feed of a nigga bleedin'
Receivin' the signals they sendin' you
Yeah, you watchin' death, eatin' death... all in ya livin' room
And you livin' proof
(I'm really him, Blood.)
Damn, Ave! Look what they did to you
Got you goin' to war witcha soul and...
Don't even know that the food and medicine is in cahoots
See, the food industry got you sick; they twisted you
All so the pharmaceutical company can say, ""Ayy!
Now, in order to unwind, you gotta take our medicinals.""
This is difficult
They got you in a bond between two place; they pickled you
On toppa that, you sip the juice
It get you loose?
I'm just keepin' it a hunnid, proof
All contributin' factors on why that COVID almost got ridda you
Here's what them crackers do
Fast food and liqour stores in every corner for the animals in the trapped-in zoo
You lookin' around at shit in ya hood, tryna figure out why it's attractin' you
Golden arches; that's symbolic language—that's how they chat witchu
""Oh, Dot's just tryna communicate.""
If you think about it more, it's cold what they got us tapped into
This is actual truth
Oh, you gettin' money in the streets?
To the crackers, that's just scraps for the rats to chew
Oh, you gettin' to the cheese? Then you get snapped behind bars
They literally settin' the same trap for you
This corner they got you backed into
You can't afford it so you fast wit' food and splash the booze
Unhealthy immune lowers ya chance-a survival if a virus is attackin' you
It's like that acronym that you gladly use
Fuck Assumptions; Check The Stats—we did; they prove
That propoganda got blacks confused
They'll throw you a rope, tellin' you to hang yaself
And you believe the reporters as you catch the news
This is all for views
Are you gettin' the vision?
COVID killin' blacks at higher rates for pre-existin' conditions
High blood pressure from all that grease on ya chicken
Ya lungs fucked up from all the blunts that ya twistin'
Yo' kidney was fucked up from all that liqour ya sippin'
And you'll turn around and get a shot in the arm from the same people that distribute everything I just mentioned
(I'm really different, nigga.)
Ain't no helpin' you niglets! What for?
I mean, it was sick then watchin' you and Sikh war
""Oh, while you was bench-pressin', I was out, dodgin' a bench warrant.""
So bein' in the gym is somethin' you wanna diss for?
That's why we gotta have this discourse
'Cause bein' in shape for a prison cell is the only thing they got you fit for
This a big war!
You gotta listen to the lesson I'm teachin'
Remember, you was drunk and belligerent
Talkin' to Verb, yellin' and screamin'
And as a man, he was calm, cool, and collected
'Cause the brother's a vegan?
The shit that you drinkin' got you spiritually unhealthy
You need to start exercisin' ya demons
Are you findin' the meanin'?
Ya brain's drownin' in sorrow from the liqour that ya top's absorbin'
This black man done took so many shots, you would think the cops was swarmin'
COVID almost took ya kidneys out without the doc performin'
I'm tryna help you find the keys to life since you almost lost ya organ
This is all important!
Find a new path! This is not the ave to take
Look, they killin' our people!
Look how they kidnapped Jelani Day!
They stole his organs, took him away
These crackers know that they dyin' so they study our genetics, lookin' to stay
I mean, they gettin' active, pocket-tappin'
Grabbin' our genes, lookin' for change
But you know what? But this culture is strange
It's a fuckin' circus; I don't understand you clowns
I mean, y'all entertained watchin' two black queens almost fight while black men just stand around?
I don't fit in wit' y'all; it's nothin' you could hand me down
""Oh, here B Dot go with the preachin'! I don't understand this shit.""
Suck my dick! You understand me now?
Fuck battle rap!
I only pick up this call for the bag
I started off in the streets
It's only right I end this all on the Ave, nigga!


I wanna holler at you, Dot
There's some shit I let rock 'cause I got respect
But bro, sometimes, you do a lot and it bothers me, I confess
'Cause yes, you clever wit' performance
And ya level of intelligence is flawless
But dawg, it's still skeletons in yo' closet
But you talk as if it ain't
Be walkin' like you the saint
And we often applaud ya art but it's awkward 'cause dawg, you fake
Like, you can't just paint this image-a pure
Judgin' niggas like you way above an issue—what? Bitch, is you sure?
Let's look some more
'Cause why you got this energy like this
When ya life is an identity crisis?
First, he writin' like he Lux so they can cut you a check
But bitch, that's bogus 'cause there's only one Loaded
Word to Russian roulette
I'm too upset that this fraud even known
Like, how you wanna be somebody when you grow up?
Bitch, you already grown!
The fuck you on?
Boy, you too far conscious
Dick-ridin' other niggas on that vibe; you all on Umar Johnson
This shit is nonsense
I mean, I'm all for positive content
But sometimes, you just come off like you beyond all the convicts
Then quick as a light switch is, he write like his life vicious
You got hammers? No, manners; you one-a Polight bitches
Like, what is this?
Like, dawg, you gotta make this shit understandable
You panther or a rooster? Stupid, just pick an animal
'Cause damn it, bro
These niggas vouch like it's all normal
While the rest of us compare you to Malcolm...
-Jamar Warner! Ol' Theo-ass nigga!
(Fuck you think talkin' to?)
We know 'bout ya life

To the folks who just wanna be free
Took all that age you too young you can't see
Ask them when was the last time they had a dream
Cause every river leads to the sea, to the sea

Casting your fears away, as it flows above the skies, the skies
Where your worries will drown out

Such a whirlwind, I want my girlfriend
Got me on ten, I can’t even pretend

Kissing her lips, and whispering in her ear
And she knows that she shouldn't listen
And that she should be with me by the water fountain


She couldn't be at home in the night time because
It made her feel alone, but at that time she was too young
I was too young
I should've built a home with a fountain for us
The moment that she told me that she was in love
Too young, I was too young
Too young, too young, too young, young

Why do my toes always feel so cold?
How come? How come? How come?
Why’s all the soap always burn like a rope?
How come? How come? How come?
When I see your reflection, it always frightens me
So strong that I can hardly speak
How come?
Mixed up potion, the summer’s ocean
I feel I’m swimming in tannin lotion
Too many car chairs, and not enough leads
How come? How come? How come?

Thank you for all the sleep
So I know the spark’s aside
Stuff that keeps me clean
Stuff that helps me breathe
The lamps, the lights, the kerosene
Beautiful, two gardenias spring
How come?

Why does all the soap always burn like the rope?
How come? How come? How come?
Why’s all my toes always seem so cold?
How come? How come? How come?"

Beautiful Small Machines,I'm Lonely,pop,"I climb into the machine and spend
two days thinking about lemonade.
I want to drink lemonade and watch the light
disappear into where I am speaking.
Language enters my life an infection in drag,
my hands feeling plural as if they're hands
but also two or more kinds of vegetables
grown in a country where the sky touches
the distant mountains in a way that is
both beautiful and meaningless, the clouds
heavy static above the village where underwear
dries on a log while a small, ageless girl
stares at the words on a bottle of soda,
not understanding the language though
imagining she does, imagining a vast
world in which this object has meaning or
(which do you think is more important?) value,
imagining the sun cut from the sky and
kept in her pocket next to a smooth cold stone
from the river where her brothers swim
and nothing is digital, and even though
lemonade is unheard of, a state of affairs
that says little about my hands (what is
there to say?), it's good enough and happening
and now here we are and I am glad. I feel
like a birthday is a good reason to be naked.
How about you? What do you think pleasure
smells like? What is your understanding of
the expression to make one's hackles rise?
I'm going to say now I'm not in control.
My T-shirt could eat me--it just seems obvious
but either way I'm going to ask you to dance.
We'll make smoothies out of rain and ride
motorcycles through fields of what has to be
commercially-grown lavender, how else
could there be so much of it? I'll tell you
that many different things have the ability
to glimmer and that is as much a reason
for joy as for terror. Do you think of what
you eat as having come from a carcass?
Does part of you not believe yourself
when you call it making love?? Does it sound
like I've been thinking about this for a long time?
I'll never really know anything and that's
why I'm on fire, helping my friend plug a tiny
amplifier into the part of me that still believes
I can wrap my disbelief in birds and bras
and that will be sufficient, or at least loud enough
to dance to without being aware of my body,
which is always in the way because the physical
world is determined by a range of parameters
but what does that matter here? Why not say
everything I feel? Everyday the sun paints me stupid
and I've never been more thankful for anything
than when my skin kisses up to oblivion
in the middle of a parking lot and my
strawberries spill out onto the pavement
like they're alive. Just look at all this! Our heads
more expensive by the minute! I put on a blue coat
and walk into the kingdom. I stand in a puddle
for twenty-five years. I stand in a puddle
and for twenty-five years I am barely born.
Now, stained and weightless, I order Chinese food
in the dark. I watch a video of people
taking off their pants in public. I watch a video
of a video of a lion eating an antelope.
I don't want to understand, I just want
to know you can hear me. My heart is pure
but I didn't say that. I'm just a bastard
cloud confusing the light, a stupid hunk
of ones and zeros trying not to not
foul up the wires. I'm stranded on the edge
of the electorate cooking my hands
in their own juices. I want to be delirious
as a cheerleader full of candy! To express myself
in increasing wolf. I want to rent out
your respiratory system with my airwaves.
Call me a man and I'll fill you with mixtapes
until you dance the feedback out of me.
My actions are excessive! Ice cream in Belarus!
October in a tree! Some precise blur
instructs me. That's how I wrote this,
hovering above the desert in a motionless vessel.
I put a giraffe in a boat and laugh.
Thinking about it isn't going to help.
Somewhere near me my inbox vibrates.
I don't have any business. I feel emotional.
I'm wasting my time. How many ways can I say
something wrong. There's piano skin
on my windowpane! Gravy sticking out of the night!
My multitasking awash in tapestries of light!
Revelation is ubiquitous, McNuggets in the grass.
I'm trying to live better, and many other things.
Every spring the meadow in its hysterical dress
and I all human and delusion. I vow through
the brouhaha with a temple in my fingerprint.
I vow through midnight with a swan
in my bourbon. I vow orgasms and antlers.
I vow to get up. And I do. But who am I
kidding? I'm not in charge. I mimic
the noise of insatiable flowers. I dress up
like a meadow and pretend I'm the world.
When I speak it is the opposite of bones.
Real life bones, my name on my hands.
I understand now, the valley full of brains.
Let's have a conversation using only our skin.
Here I'll start where I'm lonely and wet.
I will never be as good as the snow
breeding in the clouds and the world
eating the snow as it falls around the birds,
the real life birds that are ridiculous tools,
the real life birds that should be arrested
but are not, and the birds in the machine
as it hums and humans and the humming
now a kind of snow that builds and hums,
humming into the world that is a real life bird,
a bird a machine inside a real life word,
a word a totem of inarticulate grammars and grammar
a bird that should be arrested but is not. I just want
to be simple and hanging out a window with my hands
in the sky. To never die, that is the nature of
the machine, the machine that is only fog
between my fingers, the idea of a lake
emerging from the idea of rain, the idea that
I can say something and you will hear it.
That is how I know I am here. Here with birds
and stupidity and pieces of weather. Here where
I drive around all day in the blue light revolving.
Here where I speak in the shape of other humans
speaking. Here where I compare life to an avocado
and the university trembles! I drink lemonade
next to a whale. I drink lemonade and migrate
into a system of becoming. I drink lemonade
and establish relationships based on love
for things that are invisible, or in other words,
faith, which, along with stupidity,
is what brought me here thinking
about lemonade in the first place and
if I had to conceptualize what I mean
by ""first place,"" which is an expression
that denotes a temporal sequence
in terms of an abstracted spatial structure,
the beautiful thing about what I would say
is that I never knew that just thinking
about lemonade would get me here
like how when I pull a bag of oranges
out of a dumpster and make juice from them
and I'm drinking it I think about the person
who works for the grocery store who decided
to throw away that bag of oranges or who
was ordered to throw away that bag of oranges
because of the rotten orange at the bottom
and how when that grocery store employee
absent-mindedly, or perhaps not, perhaps
with a high degree of awareness, tossed
that bag of oranges into the dumpster that
person would never have imagined another person
ever touching those oranges again, let alone
eating them, and then I think back
to the truck that delivered the oranges
and the person who drove that truck and
how they might have touched these oranges
not thinking of them as oranges but as
only some materialized idea of the continual
struggle to understand how to live while
also working and doing something meaningful or
(which do you think is more important?) valuable,
and then I think back to the building
where the oranges were sorted and stickered
and bagged and back to the first truck
that took the oranges from the orange grove
and the people who picked the oranges
with their lives and the things they love and hate
and their thoughts when they read the news
and their lips and bedrooms and hands,
their hands always smelling of oranges,
which may or may not be meaningful or
(which do you think is more important?) valuable,
and their orgasms, shared or not, and how this
incongruous system of human and nonhuman motion
could lead to this bag of oranges in a dumpster
without any mouth to take in their architecture,
without these oranges satisfying some need, some
basic, universal, almost tangible need to know
that our existence is purposeful, which is often
the way one feels sitting on a park bench holding
a single orange barely caring what happens,
and how the breakdown of such a system is
something we all have to account for in our own ways
and how writing this poem feels like that,
confusion coupled with action mixed with some
vague hope that we'll somehow get somewhere,
which is why I climbed into the machine at all.
Then as long as we're here together let's agree
there be no knowing in the making, a knot,
that it show how in the motion, the machinery.
Let's agree that the only thing shared by nations
and snow is that no matter what they touch
they always disappear. Let's agree that if I took
a picture of your face right now and later showed it
to a stranger they would say Who is this beautiful person
I do not know? and I would say I do not know
because I do not pretend to know you, I only pretend
to speak. And let's agree that in the light
making its way quietly through the valley
there are noises no one knows exist that communicate
nothing and are never repeated and in that light
there is one perpetual question every person
and poem exists to answer, essentially
what's so hard about being happy being
in awe of everything? I need to believe
I would suffer to save you. Amidst cell phones
and bar glass kissing and smashing my face sentimental
for better or for worse or for even better, galloping
full of wine into the parade, removing the plexiglas
between our bodies and our bodies, and our bodies
discovering what they mean when they say
""I am in love with an emergency of symbols!""
What part of a moose don't you understand?
What would it take for you to take off your pants
in public? What if I took off my pants right now
and laid down in the grass, if we could find any,
and in an unsexual way asked you to join me?
Is that even possible? What part of the question
do you think I'm referring to and what do you think
I mean by ""possible""? I generate hogwash
in my torso! The proper use of a hammer
is to wear a petticoat and be inconsistent!
A feverish joy scatters into the citizenry!
Isn't this what's supposed to happen
going from meaning to meat to mouth?
The president stands naked in the middle
of the forest! I make sandwiches
for everyone who hates me! After that
what happens is made of fucking flowers.
I look out my window at the light
licking snow off the dumb bodies of air
conditioning units and finally get a grasp
on why everything I love is so leaving.
Why something in a word out of its body
makes me feel everywhere as air, air that live
in mouths and birds all peach pie and dynamite.
All genetic ballistics in the begonias. I am
the first person ever to touch this tree and for this
the thing that is the word that is my soul
is happy. I mumble into the incredible.
I kiss the idea of peace and give in to feeling
vulnerable despite what's foreign about my teeth.
Believe me I swear what I mean when I'm lying.
I want to cuddle until our bodies go
gossamer. I want to know how much gasoline
it would take to get me and all my friends
to California. I want to know what would happen
if instead of gasoline it was lemonade and instead
of California it was the kind of sky that happens
over California and instead of the sky over
California it was just me and you and a bag of oranges
astonishing our faces. It has something to do with
how I want to build a symphony for breakfast. How
I'm angry at clouds. How sometimes I imagine
my credit card laying in the much at the bottom
of the ocean surrounded by glowing tubes
eating other glowing tubes. How I want to collide
with everything. It takes a wound for a wound
to heal and I need the light to make a mistake of me.
Chemical fantastic, this world inexplicable.
I prop open the screen door with a broken
harmonium. I vote for a lake. I breathe
the same air as birds. I wrap myself in beer.
I was born here of parents born here
from parents the same. They went to work
between boilers and ate tires with Hart Crane.
They walked on their elbows to lick fire
from the river. They got divorces
and more divorces and I got myself a name.
The name a child at the end of its body.
Like in the infant dark an instinctual verb.
A glitch in the organ of my name. My name
displaced from its architecture and there
the machine approaching me like an animal
tamer lonely for its animal and both of us
asleep in some plural center, though
on the periphery my body never sleeps,
since the day I was born--code stumbling
and unclear, an ecosystem inventing itself
under the overpass, and you and me and
all our friends touching our gonads
as if our hands were about to go extinct,
as if I couldn't say at least one thing
that matters even the slightest bit to someone,
as if language is an exit with no way out
and we're all scratching our names into
the final obelisk surrounded by the perfume
of a thousand thousand wires tattooed
to the air emitting tongueless mysteries
in the amphitheatres of our heavy skulls
where some unknowable yawning limit
infects us with the flesh of the entire universe,
airplanes full of wilderness nuzzling the stars,
and a young, ageless, girl cutting the sun from the sky
and keeping it in her pocket next to a cold
smooth stone from the river where her brothers
swim and nothing is digital, a young girl
not responsible for the pageant between
her ears and hence imagining no war
other than the tension between the space
where the pattern ends and whatever
isn't the pattern begins. Does it bother you
that in the dark the billboards are still there?
Do you have an understanding of the legal system
of your country in relation to other countries?
Would it be beautiful to be a window?
Would you rather be sincere or a river?
Does camping make you feel less complicit?
Complicit in what? What lobular fervor?
Which ocean of whiskey? Why can't I
stop loving you? Rather than answers,
does the asking of these questions point
towards the essential issue to our being
in the world and communicating which is that
language knows more about the world
than we ever will? Or am I framing this wrong?
Does language know anything or is it just
some kind of technology, an aviary, a field
of scissors? Is it worth it to worry or should
I keep thinking about lemonade?
Aren't they the same breed of wolf?
O endless array of the occasional and scarfs!
Dost thou delight in unsober'd music?
I have a notion to essence! I'm running out
of decisions! A bird lives in a bird's mouth
says the letter I've been writing you
every night for ten thousand years. O collateral
dandelion! A blue coat ringing in the kingdom.
This music is a warning: I'm nothing but stupid.
All this is is a fist full of telephones
filled with the same immense voicemail,
an almost translucent string of sounds
resembling light more than language,
the basic message being: I feel fucking yes.
My heart making out with your heart in the mist
of sprinklers, our hips secret beaches sweet
with nonsense and campfire smoke and an illimitable
unspoken feeling that regardless of this being
a complete mistake it is, in fact, complete,
and amidst the ongoing collapse of laughter
and my head fills with something that is not control
in favor of reciting sunflowers on some wet wet
interstate perhaps not so far from here where
this system is neverending sufficiently and I
might fall asleep in your daffodils with a smile
smashed against my face. Can you see me
right now or are we far away from each other?
Do you know where I live or what color
my eyes are? Does that matter to you
or would you rather I act like an author?
I have no idea how I've gotten this far
without saying anything about cats.
Does that make us more or less similar?
Do you want to go up on the roof
of wherever you are and drink lemonade
with me? Do you know how close you are
to birds no matter what you're doing?
O human trying! O American bison!
Squirrels, delicious sleep, my ass! Mistakes!
Let's climb a tree and jump into a pile
of ash berries. Let's use my mother's mouth
as a door into my birthday. Let's eat pie
with our fingers and install confetti cannons
set to go off when a sad person walks by.
Let's kneel in the dirt--what is there to say?
Let's write a poem made entirely of lemonade
and email it to God. Let's undress each other
using birds. When I was nineteen I wrote
the way words look is often more interesting
than how they sound and that is something
I didn't fully grasp until I beheaded an ambulance
and swallowed the siren and since then it's been
inappropriate fabulous in my pleasure hive,
echoes twitching in my teeth, excitement
an inexhaustible ignition, evil violins pawing the sky,
reinventing the word flammable to start again
from ashes, blood bucketing in an approximation
of the circumference of an accident that's left
me blessing the abyss and the see-saw, broken
charming swarm feeling good as a pile of chairs
teetering in the tawny dawn. O vulva toggle
derelict and flickering! Lilacs locked in the pillory!
One day I'm going to die and I'll never again
feel the word tambourine rattle on my tongue
and if you don't think it ""makes sense"" to wear
corsages made of rain disconnected from the sky,
or to draw perforated lines on each others' bodies
and rename our favorite parts after Swedish cities,
or to ride vintage mopeds through fogs of moths,
or to tremble in phone booths and feel the bones
under our faces, or to sit in trees and discuss
the entropy of snow, or to illuminate the city
with accumulation and lack of health insurance,
or to feel hummingbird and uncertainty, our flasks
full of fumbling and lightning, or to invent a machine
whose only function is to articular the feeling
of sitting in a meadow knowing you are going
to leave the person you thought you loved,
or to never carry an umbrella when it rains
because as far as I know it always rains,
then I recommend a steady diet of fucked-up
hope until the ancient wrong that is really
a flock of disasters in human clothing
reveals itself to you as the harvest of wreckage
and incantation growing in the undergrowth
of everybody's confusion. Do you understand
why any ambiguous desire, i.e. lemonade,
would lead to all this? Why I can describe weeping
as radiant? Why a cage made of syntax and sex
is where my heart lives with its little hands
tangling what I think I'm feeling into a large
audible error? I don't need any proof! Religion
in the feedback--I don't need any proof. Anything
beautiful will save you! Truth is too basic, I want it
baffling and static. Just lie down in the grass
with your soul full of swag. Inconsistent the glitch
I sound in my hoping. Do not expect a delay.
Expect wires kissing. Expect the day to spill electric
from the truncated shrine where our mouths
fumble and spill, where artillery is no long kept
in the drapery, where each moment inherits
the momentum of brittle and raw arrangements.
The neck leaks louder, each move a mangled
allegiance between etiquette and serration.
Notice how the machine breathes and notice,
now, how close your teeth are to your tongue,
tongue that needs no warrant to magnify
the wound that is the formlessness of thought,
tongue drenched in accidental embroidery
from which the design of the machine splinters
into gesture and voice, is infectious in the fact
that our faces are not abstract, that we are
moving deliciously through our lives surrounded
by an influx of feeling in the blooming
people, the people who are my friends wearing
light on their eyes and lavishing one another
in irregular forms of benevolence in this language
in which I am constantly failing to say how much
I love you. You who wear hats and stumble
against concrete and vagary. Who disrupt
the system with one massive, eternal glass
of lemonade that glows and twists the whole
world art-shaped, the wind turning trees
into tonal blur, a thousand voices pushing
the machine through my veins as my friends
speak and sleep in the rain, umbrella-less
and trying, as the pulp and glint of the system
undergoes alteration with one shard of music
rising up from the golden surface of my friends,
let's get free, let's get free, let's get free and feed
the machine our underwear and our birds
and our hands, all of which are both meaningful
and valuable because meaning and value
are unbearably soldered to the meat
of living, so that we have nothing but happiness
and the machine that eats itself and eats itself
eating itself as we move back into the world
making all these fucking mistakes, then
Neil Young, then lawnmowers atop our graves.
But no matter what the grass will keep growing.
The dictionary will cough up its harmonies.
Love will pour out of phonemes and machines
and I will stand next to you, a glass of lemonade
beside a glass of lemonade, and I hope
by then you and I will finally be friends."

Come bite my thumb, I hope you know the stakes
I'll put a slug between your shoulder blades then ask what light through yonder poser breaks?
I hath been iambic on that ass, ye bastard
My rhymes are classic, your crap is drafted by a kindergartener high on acid
Ye hoebag, you're an old white Soulja Boy who has no swag
And no gonads, egads, it's so sad
And to top it off, you're not a doctor, I've never seen a softer author
You crook, you, I bet you wrote The Twilight books too

I would not could not on a boat read any of the boring ass plays you wrote
Even Horton doesn't want to hear you and Cindy Lou Who is afraid to go near you
You bore people to death, you leave a classroom looking like the end of MacBeth
I entertain a child of any age, you gotta translate what you said on the opposite page
How you gonna battle with the Cat in The Hat? Little kids get scared when I step on the mat
You think your ruffled neck ass gonna rap to that? I got a best selling book about me coming back


I'm switching up my style like the Beatles with my pieces, each is such a wonder with a plethora of features
You're pathetically predictable, you think your new book might include a trisyllabic meter and some ghetto Muppet creatures
The Bard is in the building, it's a castle, I'm a boss, I bet I'm Parliament, I'm positive, I'm killing it, I'm iller
Than the plague I never caught or cholera, a baller baller on some cricket bowler business while you're sitting in the bleachers

You can take your fancy words and send 'em back home to your mama
Break our foot off in your ass with our feetie pajamas

Too afraid to take those uncertain steps

Yeah, two years ago we were stronger then

When we dove head first, we were so alive
Risking everything trying to change lives
Now, my red eyes filled with shallow compromise
Ripping tickets, split commitment, future undefined


I never wanted to watch us fight like war
And turn away from each other
We had to stop and surrender to restore
And find a way to recover
Losing all we should have been
Consequences made in this failure on to feel again, feel again


Blacked out, misguided rage
Grown to separate our hardened hearts from our resentful brains
No way to see how far down you’ll land
When the fall you take wasn’t part of your plan
Doomed if you do, disowned if you don’t
No way out for any one of us

(Tears in your mind's eye, reflection of your-)



Yo, chilling in the foreign corner, tryna find a quarter
Thoughts ripple like reflections in the water
Representative of the poor, but fuck law and order
The mind taught ya, in time we'll try and force ya
Tempt a slug from a Porsche into a Corsa
And I ain't even called her, like a broke car they tryna stall ya
If they fool ya, I ain't here to school ya
Just listen, no fees or admission
No tricks, no magician
On a mission with a bitch that looks like an Egyptian
Spit non-fiction, sellouts; we ain't mixing
With our calibre, from the sword of excalibur
Break your sound's limit like pushing the speed-barrier
I have to laugh at ya, you're scared of the past, not the few crumbs from the hourglass for the final dash
Me? I'm tryna get your granddad's vinyl stash
The work-rate'll show you who's the king when time has passed


A bag of regrets, a baggy of achievements
I'll take a pinch of each and wile the fuck out for an evening
I'm just tryna add the seasoning, salt on well
Push it for a reason, cause we just believed in this way of speaking
Could'a been a dick or been ya hero
It's just a gamble; Casino without Robert De Niro
Then people started placing bets on my gang of weirdos
And looking back they'll say we ran this 
Keep it deep from where the beard grows
Many influences: people, substance abuses
Some good, some fucking useless
Keep it on the straight and zooted
Shit was sometimes stupid, heads or tails sonic's booted out the door
We called for heads and put it all on music
Never know the heart-breaker 'til you've been a partaker
Play the game called path-shaper, more points, put your heart face-up
And looking back, I'm just the keenest guy that's slack
That's putting glasto on the map if you like hip-hop in your raps

I believed in my dreams, and I always had a plan
Got regrets, tryna rearrange them like an anagram
Bullet-proof love to all the fam that's always had my back
Now my kids are partly a reflection of the man I am
They got their own path and don't need to follow mine
Anything they need though? I've always got the time
Life is how you spend time, and how you feed your mind
Life is who you inspire, then what you leave behind
On reflection, it's easier to see the light
Than when you're in the moment, and you can't read the signs
You need the time, to heal your mind
Redesign past thoughts, see what you feel inside
The freedom of youth, the wisdom of age
I spent about half my life putting things on the page
Sitting, analysing, plus maybe fantasising, drifting, and I'm feeling like my hand is guided



Memories are so spectacular
Reflecting on the past, yet we can't bring it back for ya
Fashion might've changed but the music stays classic
No synths, no lasers, no auto-tune, just straight bangers
You can't teach an old dog new tricks
We get the green, pick out the leafs, flip the skin and roll it backwards
(Jeheezey)
Take a breath like an asthmatic, then pop the flames off
Like we're volcanic
Never getting no reaction like a broke magnet
Cat's go crazy when we rap, like we're holding catnip
Back in the day, I go to Brixton jam, get in the club
With a fake ID, hit the open-mic and fucking smash it
Now I'm touring round the world, marking off the atlas
Soon to take this shit galactic
Receiving what I wish, the future stays attractive
Walking down the train-tracks at night, with a box of matches
You might not like to do that, frankly man, I find it magic
Got caught vandalising trains, I couldn't stop the habit
Court-cases, youth-offender work, it was so tragic
But it led to writing raps it was my rite of passage
Channel energies in new ways, survive the madness
Staying true to my roots, never in the system
Not a victim, never listened
Did my own thing, I'm ecstatic
This my job, my life yeah
I'm forever rapping
That's the actions if you really wanna make it platinum
Dedication to the core's one love and real passion
Times past, and turn into history
What comes next, still remains a mystery
I look to the past, then onto the future
Reflecting on my memories, the heavy I salute ya
Times past, and turn into history
What comes next, still remains a mystery

sloppy dim,to pass,rap,"A Face in the Crowd

It is easy to northern people to rise early on Midsummer morning, to see the dew on the grassy edge of the dusty pathway, to notice the fresh shoots among the darker green of the oak and fir in the coppice, and to look over the gate at the shorn meadow, without recollecting that it is the Nativity of Saint John the Baptist.

Not so to the Florentine—still less to the Florentine of the fifteenth century: to him on that particular morning the brightness of the eastern sun on the Arno had something special in it; the ringing of the bells was articulate, and declared it to be the great summer festival of Florence, the day of San Giovanni.

San Giovanni had been the patron saint of Florence for at least eight hundred years—ever since the time when the Lombard Queen Theodolinda had commanded her subjects to do him peculiar honour; nay, says old Villani, to the best of his knowledge, ever since the days of Constantino the Great and Pope Sylvester, when the Florentines deposed their idol Mars, whom they were nevertheless careful not to treat with contumely; for while they consecrated their beautiful and noble temple to the honour of God and of the

“Beato Messere Santo Giovanni,”

they placed old Mars respectfully on a high tower near the River Arno, finding in certain ancient memorials that he had been elected as their tutelar deity under such astral influences that if he were broken, or otherwise treated with indignity, the city would suffer great damage and mutation. But in the fifteenth century that discreet regard to the feelings of the Man-destroyer had long vanished: the god of the spear and shield had ceased to frown by the side of the Arno, and the defences of the Republic were held to lie in its craft and its coffers. For spear and shield could be hired by gold florins, and on the gold florins there had always been the image of San Giovanni.

Much good had come to Florence since the dim time of struggle between the old patron and the new: some quarrelling and bloodshed, doubtless, between Guelf and Ghibelline, between Black and White, between orthodox sons of the Church and heretic Paterini; some floods, famine, and pestilence; but still much wealth and glory. Florence had achieved conquests over walled cities once mightier than itself, and especially over hated Pisa, whose marble buildings were too high and beautiful, whose masts were too much honoured on Greek and Italian coasts. The name of Florence had been growing prouder and prouder in all the courts of Europe, nay, in Africa itself, on the strength of purest gold coinage, finest dyes and textures, pre-eminent scholarship and poetic genius, and wits of the most serviceable sort for statesmanship and banking: it was a name so omnipresent that a Pope with a turn for epigram had called Florentines

“the fifth element.”

And for this high destiny, though it might partly depend on the stars and Madonna dell’ Impruneta, and certainly depended on other higher Powers less often named, the praise was greatly due to San Giovanni, whose image was on the fair gold florins.

Therefore it was fitting that the day of San Giovanni—that ancient Church festival already venerable in the days of Saint Augustine—should be a day of peculiar rejoicing to Florence, and should be ushered in by a vigil duly kept in strict old Florentine fashion, with much dancing, with much street jesting, and perhaps with not a little stone-throwing and window-breaking, but emphatically with certain street sights such as could only be provided by a city which held in its service a clever Cecca, engineer and architect, valuable alike in sieges and in shows. By the help of Cecca, the very saints, surrounded with their almond-shaped glory, and floating on clouds with their joyous companionship of winged cherubs, even as they may be seen to this day in the pictures of Perugino, seemed, on the eve of San Giovanni, to have brought their piece of the heavens down into the narrow streets, and to pass slowly through them; and, more wonderful still, saints of gigantic size, with attendant angels, might be seen, not seated, but moving in a slow mysterious manner along the streets, like a procession of colossal figures come down from the high domes and tribunes of the churches. The clouds were made of good woven stuff, the saints and cherubs were unglorified mortals supported by firm bars, and those mysterious giants were really men of very steady brain, balancing themselves on stilts, and enlarged, like Greek tragedians, by huge masks and stuffed shoulders; but he was a miserably unimaginative Florentine who thought only of that—nay, somewhat impious, for in the images of sacred things was there not some of the virtue of sacred things themselves? And if, after that, there came a company of merry black demons well armed with claws and thongs, and other implements of sport, ready to perform impromptu farces of bastinadoing and clothes-tearing, why, that was the demons’ way of keeping a vigil, and they, too, might have descended from the domes and the tribunes. The Tuscan mind slipped from the devout to the burlesque, as readily as water round an angle; and the saints had already had their turn, had gone their way, and made their due pause before the gates of San Giovanni, to do him honour on the eve of his festa. And on the morrow, the great day thus ushered in, it was fitting that the tributary symbols paid to Florence by all its dependent cities, districts, and villages, whether conquered, protected, or of immemorial possession, should be offered at the shrine of San Giovanni in the old octagonal church, once the cathedral and now the baptistery, where every Florentine had had the sign of the Cross made with the anointing chrism on his brow; that all the city, from the white-haired man to the stripling, and from the matron to the lisping child, should be clothed in its best to do honour to the great day, and see the great sight; and that again, when the sun was sloping and the streets were cool, there should be the glorious race or Corso, when the unsaddled horses, clothed in rich trappings, should ran right across the city, from the Porta al Prato on the north-west, through the Mercato Vecchio, to the Porta Santa Croce on the south-east, where the richest of Palii, or velvet and brocade banners with silk linings and fringe of gold, such as became a city that half-clothed the well-dressed world, were mounted on a triumphal car awaiting the winner or winner’s owner.

And thereafter followed more dancing; nay, through the whole day, says an old chronicler at the beginning of that century, there were weddings and the grandest gatherings, with so much piping, music and song, with balls and feasts and gladness and ornament, that this earth might have been mistaken for Paradise!

In this year of 1492, it was, perhaps, a little less easy to make that mistake. Lorenzo the magnificent and subtle was dead, and an arrogant, incautious Piero was come in his room, an evil change for Florence, unless, indeed, the wise horse prefers the bad rider, as more easily thrown from the saddle, and already the regrets for Lorenzo were getting less predominant over the murmured desire for government on a broader basis, in which corruption might be arrested, and there might be that free play for everybody’s jealousy and ambition, which made the ideal liberty of the good old quarrelsome, struggling times, when Florence raised her great buildings, reared her own soldiers, drove out would-be tyrants at the sword’s point, and was proud to keep faith at her own loss. Lorenzo was dead, Pope Innocent was dying, and a troublesome Neapolitan succession, with an intriguing, ambitious Milan, might set Italy by the ears before long: the times were likely to be difficult. Still, there was all the more reason that the Republic should keep its religious festivals.

And Midsummer morning, in this year 1492, was not less bright than usual. It was betimes in the morning that the symbolic offerings to be carried in grand procession were all assembled at their starting-point in the Piazza della Signoria—that famous piazza, where stood then, and stand now, the massive turreted Palace of the People, called the Palazzo Vecchio, and the spacious Loggia, built by Orcagna—the scene of all grand State ceremonial. The sky made the fairest blue tent, and under it the bells swung so vigorously that every evil spirit with sense enough to be formidable, must long since have taken his flight; windows and terraced roofs were alive with human faces; sombre stone houses were bright with hanging draperies; the boldly soaring palace tower, the yet older square tower of the Bargello, and the spire of the neighbouring Badia, seemed to keep watch above; and below, on the broad polygonal flags of the piazza, was the glorious show of banners, and horses with rich trappings, and gigantic ceri, or tapers, that were fitly called towers—strangely aggrandised descendants of those torches by whose faint light the Church worshipped in the Catacombs. Betimes in the morning all processions had need to move under the Midsummer sky of Florence, where the shelter of the narrow streets must every now and then be exchanged for the glare of wide spaces; and the sun would be high up in the heavens before the long pomp had ended its pilgrimage in the Piazza di San Giovanni.
But here, where the procession was to pause, the magnificent city, with its ingenious Cecca, had provided another tent than the sky; for the whole of the Piazza del Duomo, from the octagonal baptistery in the centre to the façade of the cathedral and the walls of the houses on the other sides of the quadrangle, was covered, at the height of forty feet or more, with blue drapery, adorned with well-stitched yellow lilies and the familiar coats of arms, while sheaves of many-coloured banners drooped at fit angles under this superincumbent blue—a gorgeous rainbow-lit shelter to the waiting spectators who leaned from the windows, and made a narrow border on the pavement, and wished for the coming of the show.

One of these spectators was Tito Melema. Bright, in the midst of brightness, he sat at the window of the room above Nello’s shop, his right elbow resting on the red drapery hanging from the window-sill, and his head supported in a backward position by the right-hand, which pressed the curls against his ear. His face wore that bland liveliness, as far removed from excitability as from heaviness or gloom, which marks the companion popular alike amongst men and women—the companion who is never obtrusive or noisy from uneasy vanity or excessive animal spirits, and whose brow is never contracted by resentment or indignation. He showed no other change from the two months and more that had passed since his first appearance in the weather-stained tunic and hose, than that added radiance of good fortune, which is like the just perceptible perfecting of a flower after it has drunk a morning’s sunbeams. Close behind him, ensconced in the narrow angle between his chair and the window-frame, stood the slim figure of Nello in holiday suit, and at his left the younger Cennini—Pietro, the erudite corrector of proof-sheets, not Domenico the practical. Tito was looking alternately down on the scene below, and upward at the varied knot of gazers and talkers immediately around him, some of whom had come in after witnessing the commencement of the procession in the Piazza della Signoria. Piero di Cosimo was raising a laugh among them by his grimaces and anathemas at the noise of the bells, against which no kind of ear-stuffing was a sufficient barricade, since the more he stuffed his ears the more he felt the vibration of his skull; and declaring that he would bury himself in the most solitary spot of the Valdarno on a festa, if he were not condemned, as a painter, to lie in wait for the secrets of colour that were sometimes to be caught from the floating of banners and the chance grouping of the multitude.

Tito had just turned his laughing face away from the whimsical painter to look down at the small drama going on among the checkered border of spectators, when at the angle of the marble steps in front of the Duomo, nearly opposite Nello’s shop, he saw a man’s face upturned towards him, and fixing on him a gaze that seemed to have more meaning in it than the ordinary passing observation of a stranger. It was a face with tonsured head, that rose above the black mantle and white tunic of a Dominican friar—a very common sight in Florence; but the glance had something peculiar in it for Tito. There was a faint suggestion in it, certainly not of an unpleasant kind. Yet what pleasant association had he ever had with monks? None. The glance and the suggestion hardly took longer than a flash of lightning.

“Nello!”

said Tito, hastily, but immediately added, in a tone of disappointment,

“Ah, he has turned round. It was that tall, thin friar who is going up the steps. I wanted you to tell me if you knew aught of him?”

“One of the Frati Predicatori,”

said Nello, carelessly;

“you don’t expect me to know the private history of the crows.”

“I seem to remember something about his face,”

said Tito.

“It is an uncommon face.”

“What? you thought it might be our Fra Girolamo? Too tall; and he never shows himself in that chance way.”
“Besides, that loud-barking ‘hound of the Lord’ (Note 1) is not in Florence just now,”

said Francesco Cei, the popular poet;

“he has taken Piero de’ Medici’s hint, to carry his railing prophecies on a journey for a while.”

“The Frate neither rails nor prophesies against any man,”

said a middle-aged personage seated at the other corner of the window;

“he only prophesies against vice. If you think that an attack on your poems, Francesco, it is not the Frate’s fault.”

“Ah, he’s gone into the Duomo now,”

said Tito, who had watched the figure eagerly.

“No, I was not under that mistake, Nello. Your Fra Girolamo has a high nose and a large under-lip. I saw him once—he is not handsome; but this man...”

“Truce to your descriptions!”

said Cennini.

“Hark! see! Here come the horsemen and the banners. That standard,”

he continued, laying his hand familiarly on Tito’s shoulder,—“that carried on the horse with white trappings—that with the red eagle holding the green dragon between his talons, and the red lily over the eagle—is the Gonfalon of the Guelf party, and those cavaliers close round it are the chief officers of the Guelf party. That is one of our proudest banners, grumble as we may; it means the triumph of the Guelfs, which means the triumph of Florentine will, which means triumph of the popolani.”
“Nay, go on, Cennini,”

said the middle-aged man, seated at the window,

“which means triumph of the fat popolani over the lean, which again means triumph of the fattest popolano over those who are less fat.”

“Cronaca, you are becoming sententious,”

said the printer;

“Fra Girolamo’s preaching will spoil you, and make you take life by the wrong handle. Trust me, your cornices will lose half their beauty if you begin to mingle bitterness with them; that is the maniera Tedesca which you used to declaim against when you came from Rome. The next palace you build we shall see you trying to put the Frate’s doctrine into stone.”

“That is a goodly show of cavaliers,”

said Tito, who had learned by this time the best way to please Florentines;

“but are there not strangers among them? I see foreign costumes.”

“Assuredly,”

said Cennini;

“you see there the Orators from France, Milan, and Venice, and behind them are English and German nobles; for it is customary that all foreign visitors of distinction pay their tribute to San Giovanni in the train of that gonfalon. For my part, I think our Florentine cavaliers sit their horses as well as any of those cut-and-thrust northerners, whose wits lie in their heels and saddles; and for yon Venetian, I fancy he would feel himself more at ease on the back of a dolphin. We ought to know something of horsemanship, for we excel all Italy in the sports of the Giostra, and the money we spend on them. But you will see a finer show of our chief men by-and-by, Melema; my brother himself will be among the officers of the Zecca.”

“The banners are the better sight,”

said Piero di Cosimo, forgetting the noise in his delight at the winding stream of colour as the tributary standards advanced round the piazza.

“The Florentine men are so-so; they make but a sorry show at this distance with their patch of sallow flesh-tint above the black garments; but those banners with their velvet, and satin, and minever, and brocade, and their endless play of delicate light and shadow!—Va! your human talk and doings are a tame jest; the only passionate life is in form and colour.”

“Ay, Piero, if Satanasso could paint, thou wouldst sell thy soul to learn his secrets,”

said Nello.

“But there is little likelihood of it, seeing the blessed angels themselves are such poor hands at chiaroscuro, if one may judge from their capo-d’opera, the Madonna Nunziata.”

“There go the banners of Pisa and Arezzo,”

said Cennini.

“Ay, Messer Pisano, it is no use for you to look sullen; you may as well carry your banner to our San Giovanni with a good grace. ‘Pisans false, Florentines blind’—the second half of that proverb will hold no longer. There come the ensigns of our subject towns and signories, Melema; they will all be suspended in San Giovanni until this day next year, when they will give place to new ones.”

“They are a fair sight,”

said Tito;

“and San Giovanni will surely be as well satisfied with that produce of Italian looms as Minerva with her peplos, especially as he contents himself with so little drapery. But my eyes are less delighted with those whirling towers, which would soon make me fall from the window in sympathetic vertigo.”

The “towers” of which Tito spoke were a part of the procession esteemed very glorious by the Florentine populace; and being perhaps chiefly a kind of hyperbole for the all-efficacious wax taper, were also called ceri. But inasmuch as hyperbole is impracticable in a real and literal fashion, these gigantic ceri, some of them so large as to be of necessity carried on wheels, were not solid but hollow, and had their surface made not solely of wax, but of wood and pasteboard, gilded, carved, and painted, as real sacred tapers often are, with successive circles of figures—warriors on horseback, foot-soldiers with lance and shield, dancing maidens, animals, trees and fruits, and in fine, says the old chronicler,

“all things that could delight the eye and the heart;”

the hollowness having the further advantage that men could stand inside these hyperbolic tapers and whirl them continually, so as to produce a phantasmagoric effect, which, considering the towers were numerous, must have been calculated to produce dizziness on a truly magnificent scale.

“Pestilenza!”

said Piero di Cosimo, moving from the window,

“those whirling circles one above the other are worse than the jangling of all the bells. Let me know when the last taper has passed.”

“Nay, you will surely like to be called when the contadini come carrying their torches,”

said Nello;

“you would not miss the country-folk of the Mugello and the Casentino, of whom your favourite Leonardo would make a hundred grotesque sketches.”

“No,”

said Piero, resolutely,

“I will see nothing till the car of the Zecca comes. I have seen clowns enough holding tapers aslant, both with and without cowls, to last me for my life.”

“Here it comes, then, Piero—the car of the Zecca,”

called out Nello, after an interval during which towers and tapers in a descending scale of size had been making their slow transit.

“Fediddio!”

exclaimed Francesco Cei,

“that is a well-tanned San Giovanni! some sturdy Romagnole beggar-man, I’ll warrant. Our Signoria plays the host to all the Jewish and Christian scum that every other city shuts its gates against, and lets them fatten on us like Saint Anthony’s swine.”

The car of the Zecca or Mint, which had just rolled into sight, was originally an immense wooden tower or cero adorned after the same fashion as the other tributary ceri, mounted on a splendid car, and drawn by two mouse-coloured oxen, whose mild heads looked out from rich trappings bearing the arms of the Zecca. But the latter half of the century was getting rather ashamed of the towers with their circular or spiral paintings, which had delighted the eyes and the hearts of the other half, so that they had become a contemptuous proverb, and any ill-painted figure looking, as will sometimes happen to figures in the best ages of art, as if it had been boned for a pie, was called a fantoccio da cero, a tower-puppet; consequently improved taste, with Cecca to help it, had devised for the magnificent Zecca a triumphal car like a pyramidal catafalque, with ingenious wheels warranted to turn all corners easily. Round the base were living figures of saints and angels arrayed in sculpturesque fashion; and on the summit, at the height of thirty feet, well bound to an iron rod and holding an iron cross also firmly infixed, stood a living representative of Saint John the Baptist, with arms and legs bare, a garment of tiger-skins about his body, and a golden nimbus fastened on his head—as the Precursor was wont to appear in the cloisters and churches, not having yet revealed himself to painters as the brown and sturdy boy who made one of the Holy Family. For where could the image of the patron saint be more fitly placed than on the symbol of the Zecca? Was not the royal prerogative of coining money the surest token that a city had won its independence? and by the blessing of San Giovanni this “beautiful sheepfold” of his had shown that token earliest among the Italian cities. Nevertheless, the annual function of representing the patron saint was not among the high prizes of public life; it was paid for with something like ten shillings, a cake weighing fourteen pounds, two bottles of wine, and a handsome supply of light eatables; the money being furnished by the magnificent Zecca, and the payment in kind being by peculiar “privilege” presented in a basket suspended on a pole from an upper window of a private house, whereupon the eidolon of the austere saint at once invigorated himself with a reasonable share of the sweets and wine, threw the remnants to the crowd, and embraced the mighty cake securely with his right arm through the remainder of his passage. This was the attitude in which the mimic San Giovanni presented himself as the tall car jerked and vibrated on its slow way round the piazza to the northern gate of the Baptistery.

“There go the Masters of the Zecca, and there is my brother—you see him, Melema?”

cried Cennini, with an agreeable stirring of pride at showing a stranger what was too familiar to be remarkable to fellow-citizens.

“Behind come the members of the Corporation of Calimara, (Note 2) the dealers in foreign cloth, to which we have given our Florentine finish; men of ripe years, you see, who were matriculated before you were born; and then comes the famous Art of Money-changers.”

“Many of them matriculated also to the noble art of usury before you were born,”

interrupted Francesco Cei,

“as you may discern by a certain fitful glare of the eye and sharp curve of the nose which manifest their descent from the ancient Harpies, whose portraits you saw supporting the arms of the Zecca. Shaking off old prejudices now, such a procession as that of some four hundred passably ugly men carrying their tapers in open daylight, Diogenes-fashion, as if they were looking for a lost quattrino, would make a merry spectacle for the Feast of Fools.”

“Blaspheme not against the usages of our city,”

said Pietro Cennini, much offended.

“There are new wits who think they see things more truly because they stand on their heads to look at them, like tumblers and mountebanks, instead of keeping the attitude of rational men. Doubtless it makes little difference to Maestro Vaiano’s monkeys whether they see our Donatello’s statue of Judith with their heads or their tails uppermost.”

“Your solemnity will allow some quarter to playful fancy, I hope,”

said Cei, with a shrug,

“else what becomes of the ancients, whose example you scholars are bound to revere, Messer Pietro? Life was never anything but a perpetual see-saw between gravity and jest.”

“Keep your jest then till your end of the pole is uppermost,”

said Cennini, still angry,

“and that is not when the great bond of our Republic is expressing itself in ancient symbols, without which the vulgar would be conscious of nothing beyond their own petty wants of back and stomach, and never rise to the sense of community in religion and law. There has been no great people without processions, and the man who thinks himself too wise to be moved by them to anything but contempt, is like the puddle that was proud of standing alone while the river rushed by.”

No one said anything after this indignant burst of Cennini’s till he himself spoke again.

“Hark! the trumpets of the Signoria: now comes the last stage of the show, Melema. That is our Gonfaloniere in the middle, in the starred mantle, with the sword carried before him. Twenty years ago we used to see our foreign Podesta, who was our judge in civil causes, walking on his right-hand; but our Republic has been over-doctored by clever Medici. That is the Proposto (Spokesman or Moderator) of the Priori on the left; then come the other seven Priori; then all the other magistracies and officials of our Republic. You see your patron the Segretario?”

“There is Messer Bernardo del Nero also,”

said Tito;

“his visage is a fine and venerable one, though it has worn rather a petrifying look towards me.”

“Ah,” said Nello,

“he is the dragon that guards the remnant of old Bardo’s gold, which, I fancy, is chiefly that virgin gold that falls about the fair Romola’s head and shoulders; eh, my Apollino?”

he added, patting Tito’s head.

Tito had the youthful grace of blushing, but he had also the adroit and ready speech that prevents a blush from looking like embarrassment. He replied at once—

“And a very Pactolus it is—a stream with golden ripples. If I were an alchemist—”

He was saved from the need for further speech by the sudden fortissimo of drums and trumpets and fifes, bursting into the breadth of the piazza in a grand storm of sound—a roar, a blast, and a whistling, well befitting a city famous for its musical instruments, and reducing the members of the closest group to a state of deaf isolation.

During this interval Nello observed Tito’s fingers moving in recognition of some one in the crowd below, but not seeing the direction of his glance he failed to detect the object of this greeting—the sweet round blue-eyed face under a white hood—immediately lost in the narrow border of heads, where there was a continual eclipse of round contadina cheeks by the harsh-lined features or bent shoulders of an old spadesman, and where profiles turned as sharply from north to south as weathercocks under a shifting wind.

But when it was felt that the show was ended—when the twelve prisoners released in honour of the day, and the very barberi or race-horses, with the arms of their owners embroidered on their cloths, had followed up the Signoria, and been duly consecrated to San Giovanni, and every one was moving from the window—Nello, whose Florentine curiosity was of that lively canine sort which thinks no trifle too despicable for investigation, put his hand on Tito’s shoulder and said—

“What acquaintance was that you were making signals to, eh, giovane mio?”

“Some little contadina who probably mistook me for an acquaintance, for she had honoured me with a greeting.”

“Or who wished to begin an acquaintance,”

said Nello.

“But you are bound for the Via de’ Bardi and the feast of the Muses: there is no counting on you for a frolic, else we might have gone in search of adventures together in the crowd, and had some pleasant fooling in honour of San Giovanni. But your high fortune has come on you too soon: I don’t mean the professor’s mantle—that is roomy enough to hide a few stolen chickens, but— Messer Endymion minded his manners after that singular good fortune of his; and what says our Luigi Pulci?

“‘Da quel giorno in qua ch’amor m’accese
Per lei son fatto e gentile e cortese.’”

“Nello, amico mio, thou hast an intolerable trick of making life stale by forestalling it with thy talk,”

said Tito, shrugging his shoulders, with a look of patient resignation, which was his nearest approach to anger:

“not to mention that such ill-founded babbling would be held a great offence by that same goddess whose humble worshipper you are always professing yourself.”

“I will be mute,”

said Nello, laying his finger on his lips, with a responding shrug.

“But it is only under our four eyes that I talk any folly about her.”

“Pardon! you were on the verge of it just now in the hearing of others. If you want to ruin me in the minds of Bardo and his daughter—”

“Enough, enough!”

said Nello.

“I am an absurd old barber. It all comes from that abstinence of mine, in not making bad verses in my youth: for want of letting my folly run out that way when I was eighteen, it runs out at my tongue’s end now I am at the unseemly age of fifty. But Nello has not got his head muffled for all that; he can see a buffalo in the snow. Addio, giovane mio.”"

Insane Clown Posse,Clown Show,rap,"Come one and come all, everybody know me
I'm the class clown all around, and every day the ho me
It was hilariously funny when they beat me up in the gym
I was honored and privileged they’d let me be with them
And it's funny as hell when they diss on what I wear
And they smack my head up when I try to fix up my hair
I'm so funny, I amuse even the teachers
Others beat me in the yard, and they just laugh from the bleachers


It ain’t so funny when the shows over (and it ain't so funny)
The storm blows over (and it ain't so funny)
And I chose no more (and it ain't so funny)


I got a standing ovation when I fell on my face in the class
Somebody shoe-laced my ass
They spit on my seat. They spit in my food
They spit on my face. This audience here is rude
Well, I stepped up to Sarah. I thought I'd say hi
She laughs at my show so much, figured I'd try
I asked her would she like to join me for piece of pizza pie
But she'd rather die, die, die
I visioned a bazooka barrel aimed at her face
And all that remains are pigtails floating in place
But that's only a vision and this is reality
I’ve got all of these people laughing at me, how stale of me
Smile! I’m smiling now. Mean faces and looks
Somebody kicked me in the ass, and I dropped all my books
Oh God, I'm so funny, and it’s all accidental again
I just want my clown freak show to end

And I chose no more (and it ain’t so funny)


I hop out of bed, woke up early this morning
'Cause this day here marked this clown's final performance
I ran off to school in my new clown costume clothes
I even painted my face for you hoes. Here it goes
I walk down the hall, and they all laughin' immensely
They know it's me, automatically. They all against me
But off in my bag, between two books and a folder
Is a .357 Magnum, fully loaded, with a holster
Some teachers tell me to stop, but I walk right on past
I'm headed to my performance for the first hour class
Just in time. There's the bell. I take to the stage
Jump up on the teacher's desk, laughing with rage
Come one and come all! Let me show you a trick!
It's amazing! I'll reach in this bag here, right quick!
This a .357, fully loaded and all
Now look at the back of my head on the wall


It ain't so funny when the shows over (and it ain't so funny)
The storm blows over (and it ain't so funny)
And I chose no more (and it ain't so funny)
It ain't so funny when the shows over (and it ain't so funny)
The storm blows over (and it ain't so funny)
And I chose no more (and it ain't so funny)

""Every sodomite will get a flame coming out of his butthole!
God's gonna have a flame coming out of your butthole!
There'll be people walking around all over America, with flames coming out of their butthole!
Everyone who takes it up the rear, everyone who has a penis injected in his butthole, when that penis comes out, the flame will start burning!"""

What you hear me talkin' bout, you just ain't gon find out
Walkin' round in somebody's club, now she's sayin her house
But when she hit the scene, shawty do it so mean
And everybody round is affected by the being
Man i'm talkin' real hott even if you get a shot
Everythin' else you got, will totally be forgot
You can see it in her face, you can see it in her shape
Nigga's see it and immediately go pull out a key
Way before they get the sex, go start spendin' checks
Broke ones send her flowers, Rich nigga's sendin' jets
Man the behind on her, shawty got a mind on her
Independent wit' it, baby girl got a grind on her
All that'll make you fall, All that'll make you ball
Run up in the mall, damn near try to buy it all
So if you got a wife, and some kids at home
Might aswell go head and make ??

Shawty keep it real tight, make it feel real right
Just what I be lookin for, leave me feenin wantin' more
In the dictionary she body by the word 'woah'
I just love ya style, drive a nigga wild
Brighten up my day, you make me wanna smile
I just wanna fell your touch, to me girl you're so much
Knew that you would shine from the first time that we crushed
The room was so dark, back had a mean arch
Through me apart and from the start, took a nigga's heart
Girl I think you the best, and I probably need a rest
Cos I ain't stopped since I seen you and you said yes
I never told you this, but the juicyness of your lips
Got me crazy, that's why I love to kiss
You, it's true, got your boy in a twist
Ha! Now I'm gone like Swiss.."

'Cause my words come to life, they got legs
If she think she above what they call love, then make her say it
Shawty pulled my card, but she was smart not to play it
Don't have the leverage to remind me what I said
Shawty broke my heart to the core and I bled
She want me to get down on my knees, I won't beg
Love don't cost a thing, but they be taxin', bustin' heads
But if you in love, do what it does, break a leg

Attitude,Champion,rap,"You're so arrogant your websites called The Saurus wins
Your e-mails world rap champion, your clothing's Legendary
Yeah you're the king
It's like you're telling us what we outta think
But most people just see a fat loser with awful skin
You're wack at everything your music's such a sad depressing thing
It'll probably turn Hollohan back to heroin
Your facial expressions make you look like a fucking weirdo
It's like you have a mental twitch
It's like you have Tourettes
You're tick is to make your face uglier than it already is
The faces you pull just get me pissed
There's no need to screw your face up, God already did
I hate looking at your face when I spit
I hope which ever camera angle that captures your mangled
Face reacting to this battle corrupts when they edit this
He's competitive at everything, I bet even when you play with your daughter
You never let her win in board games
And cheat in every card game that you taught her
Quit this world rap champion attitude, Illmaculate carried you
You're a bad excuse of a rapper, don't act like you gamble too
Cause you split the money in the finals when they handed you Waps and Juice
Out of everyone there you split 50 grand with the wackest two
What kinda gambling man are you?
I find it odd you even started panicking that you'd lose
And couldn't gamble in the easiest battle you had to do
But I think you need to gamble less cause if you keep on having bets
You'll overload and won't be the only Greek in massive debt
And the tracks that you do are even fucking wacker than usual
I know you respect me but the respect you have isn't mutual
So when you hand me your CD for free I'll be happy you do
So I can throw that shit on the ground and give it my stamp of approval

It's Freddie Cruger, London native
Some would say you're underrated
This is like putting The Rock against...""It doesn't matter what your name is!""
Let's talk about your alter ego, just in case it doesn't make it
He's more like Harvey Dent: you got a couple faces like a double agent
Battle Rap Comedian, Horror-core stage performer
Necro-worshiper, painting portraits of rape and torture
In mom's basement screaming angry tortured tape recorder
Bitches all describe Cruger with two words: ""restraining order""
Now I don't believe a word you say, he isn't very threatening
He's just introverted skinny Freddie, shit is real depressing
Now, in Britain, they'll be checking the obituary section
'Cause the blade is leaving Cru cut like a military veteran
Now you real soft but you still talking
With kill shots I'm a real problem, taking your bread
Plate in his head from the meal cart you get wheeled off in
If it's real close than I will rob him til I field goal like I'm Phil Dawson
And if he ain't got nothing to steal off him, I'mma steal on him
Fuck Phil Collins, I'm Phil Jackson bitch! Let me show you how
A player from another era going back to coaching now
I hold the crown, what? You think you can expose me clown?
Talk about my broken-down ex-bitch in your closing round?
Look he's panicking, that info wasn't supposed to be found
It was sorry pussy, I'll have her do was show me around
This is my one time slowing it down
I said, ""Sorry pussy, all I had Eurgh do was show me a round""
Friendship over

Your album's called All I Know Is That
I don't know the tracks, all I know is that
But we all know 'Mac makes the sicker music
Since he'll never put you on you put him on some shit that you did
So you finally done track I guess he ran out of his excuses
And thought if it's on a Saurus album at least no one'll listen to it
Most successful rappers that battle it's obvious there
Doing it as a step before they get that song on the air
Battling for ten years or any longer is rare
You're stuck on the first step
You're too fat to even climb metaphorical stairs
Your clothes stretch cause they're tight, whatever the size
The only thing you fit is the American stereo type
Plus your facial texture is like an American pie
We're talking the one that got fucked in American Pie
You ain't swag dripping you're sweat dripping
You're a fat sweaty troll
With man breasts and bad breath to go with your bad breath control
But the way you fall in love with every chick you met explains
Your breath control in battles cause I guess it takes your breath away
His ex is Canadian, his last girlfriend was Australian
You get whipped outside of your own country like racism
And underage girls are the only ones dating him
'Cause they got something in common: problems with facial skin
But at least before you get the engagement ring
You can talk to their parents on the level
Cause you'll be the same age as 'em
You claim you win but you lose respect every time
You lose your voice every battle and lose your breath every line
But with laws all the time, you're losing your mind, you're such a loser you fly
8,000 miles to lose battles for loose pussy, you're losing in life
She's a 19 year old Australian battle groupie it's stupid that you loved her
But now you've got beef, cause real talk, Uno Lavoz fucked her
And she said when she came to visit you
You locked her in the house to stop her coming out
You don't have a job and spend all day slobbing on the couch
Her family hated you and never wanted you around like
I can continue, but I need a lot longer than a round

Bringing up my ex-chick isn't going too far
But Uno told me he didn't fuck her
So either one of you's a lying bitch or you both of you are
Now you need to check yourself, I ain't ever help up
Lesson dealt, every hole in your head is swelled shut
Freddie Cruger fares well with the fairy tale stuff
But his whole set disappears once the director yells ""Cut!""
Please cue the theme music, your entire scene's stupid
Be real, we ain't wasting this clip so let's reshoot it
Dude you're finished
Actors studio, you're just a student in it
I'll pick apart this Freddy Cruger gimmick like a movie critic
See he catches people sleeping, that's kind of a known thing
So I kept that shit in mind when designing my whole theme
I'm Cruger's idol so tonight I provided a smoke screen
To finally kill Freddy inside of his own dream
I'm wide awake for y'all to witness this sonning
A heart to heart talk about the man he isn't becoming
Shit it'd be funny if you really were considering ducking
Since history done proved that the British are nothing!
Now let me finish discussing how much I hate Freddy Cruger
My name's Reggie Miller, I'm the game ending shooter
This day couldn't have came any sooner, I'mma plane headed through you
Like it's aimed at the Trade Center, Cruger
I'm fat cause I stay fed, J. Edgar Hoover
It ain't any rumor
I'm taking away Freddy's future
We don't have the same sense of humor
Your punches are jokes, mine are Mayweather Jr.'s!


You are the corniest human being alive
With cheeks looking like you smoke weed til you're tired
And fall asleep on the grinder
Why he can't make it that evening on fire
Cause your face hit the flint and started dripping in grease to the lighter
In every battle you say ""you're a faggot""
That's soon gotta end
You made the word ""faggot"" so uncool, you do not offend
In fact you're probably the gay community's friend
Cause you've turned people like me off ever wanting to use it again
You're the biggest scam
Your battle with Mac Lethal was like how acrobats catch people
In any trick they land cause every flip was planned
When he was King Of The Dot he couldn't zip his trap
Hollohan put up his chain on the day, so boasting about it's pretty sad
Considering it wasn't a company's decision and
When you got it you couldn't defend it a single match
Two time winner of everything, what kinda everything is that?
You couldn't even get a win against a guy to win a chance to win it back
All the angles you take fall flat on your face
When you battled PH you rapped 'bout his age
Said he's fat, outta shape, trying to hang on to fame
Doesn't deserve a match for the chain, only relevant back in the day
The fact that his name carries no weight
Wait, fat, old, washed up and desperate for the title
You and his problems sound exactly the same
Two time winner of everything what about everything that you lose in
What about Diz', Illmac', PoRich, Diaz who do you think that you're fooling
When you won Scribble and Jumpoff it was a different movement
You're not the two time winner of everything
You're the winner of two things
Five years ago and both of them competitions got ruined
Cause everyone freed and you were using writtens to do 'em
So it's all a big hoax but I'll put an end to the myth you're persuing
Cause this won't be the first time I came to the west to kill an Illusion


We're perfect instances of why not to judge a book by it's cover
But I'm still thankful as fuck that we don't look like each other
How do you look like a pedophile and an adolescent child?
He just thinks about himself and his vagina get's a second smile
But somehow for one of us to win this, it's a good look
I said somehow I think that I can win this, with my good looks
See he's too shook to talk to women, Cruger gets embarrassed all day
Bitches exit stage left whenever Freddy stares a broads way
It's beyond gay to write verses about whores I fornicated
My pipe stay up in organs (Oregon) like a Portland native
For you, talking to bitches is a foreign language
This faggot should've been aborted
Before he was ever born in Cambridge
I thought you would be more creative or bring some shit that was new
30 English men are with him, not a single chick in the Coupe
So if they think you're winning it's cool, but let's put things in perspective
You live in England, my dick has been in more English women than you
Now speaking of vaginas, Don't Flop are cunts
Y'all need to stop the front, I'm sick of all your stunts
I almost lost my lunch, a grand prix, a magazine
Your champion's an obnoxious drunk
How 'bout come up with your own thoughts
And don't bite King Of The Dot for once
I mean, what's next guys?
Don't Flop: Fresh Coast Division?
Let me guess, mum jokes are what the west coast is missing?
That means the planet wasn't three quarters water"

I hit the gas and get on my level, and it take me there
I just might spazz, I just might crash

And I'ma blow it if a nigga try me, please don't take me there

Let's run up them numbers like fuck it
Ropes on me, double dutchin'
I don't know you so I'm clutchin'
I wasn't at no BET Awards
I wanted the XXL
They didn't wanna give me my recognition

‘Cause if they catch us out there, they'll bleed us
Shoot us, kill us, dump us in a dark ditch
Clean it up, call it a gang hit

It's a plot they use to keep down another
Here comes another brainwashed brother...


""Yo man, it sounds like you're selling out to me, ‘cause I'm from the ghetto; I lived in the ghetto all my life!
We ain't supposed to leave here! We're black! We're supposed to be poor!""

You be coming, you be going but you never close the door


You're so unsure
I ain't ever try to play you like you're stupid (So unsure)
It's just that Cupid got me sending shots at any cutie that's moving (You're so unsure)
My life is like a movie
They take the camera, throws out and then they shoot me
(So unsure)
It don't even matter what type of mood I'm in
I turn around and hear the same shit from you again"

Out of the casket just to put the masses back and I'm the best rapper that's breathing everybody look it's madic

Smashing
Turn to a monster they might need to stab a stake in my chest

Been to hell and back so frequently my demons start to pray
Triple say my name in mirrors if you really feeling brave
I'm on a roll to put it blunt all of these rapper get smoke
Cuz' I can see through all they bullshit and I just seen a ghost
They only time they can hang is with a stool and a rope
They call me Oakes except they spell it the goat

Three liter big red, got diluted nines fed
Able to make a bitch, wanna suck my naked head
I get fly when I wanna, graduated from corners
I know it tingle, cause your pussy marinated my sauna
If you capping I ain't tripping, cause I really don't need you
Prolly say your pussy gon be beat up, and having a seizure
Overseas vacation, Prime Co. communication
And radio stations, got us in regular rotation
Cause the guns unloaded, lot of heads got exploded
Destined to be the throwdest, if I'm properly promoted
Sewed it up like a sweater, financial back or go-getter
Then through your vest chest, with the talons in my baretta
Stay one step ahead of, my competition they better
Fly down from overseas sign down, and get to chumping for cheddar

You do, you better and change the wrist band

It took some time, but I decided to throw my bitch on the 4's
The bubble-eyed Mazaratti, on a mission to meet Scotty
With bullets for your body, cause I'm living like Gotti
Pistol grip and a beam, plus a murdering team
Cash rule everything me, that there ain't nothing but green
Jumping in and out of line, moving slow as I wanna
Smoking reefer bending corners, on 20 inch Yokohama
Cause these niggas be hating me, when I be crawling down
So I'm like Paul Bugsy with a infrared, cause these niggas be falling down
Steady yelling out timber, from the first dance January down to the last dance
December better remember, put a big shell casing up in you
Make you weak like SWV, when I shine and grind like E.S.G
But I gotta get love like the Big Steve, throwed in the game like that P-A-T

Your five senses through a sensational tests (count em)
To see if you can feel what's real, and once it's felt
You'll savor the taste and the smell (you've heard)
Your nerves begin tingling, your heart beats
Are reachin for life's meanin while arteries rush
A flood of blood through the right course
Givin you life force, this is a gift from life's source
Daily, wit each second deep breaths and
Your feet step in every direction
The search begins, as you work against the clock
The earth again is shocked by another bad creation
I cried too, at birth at first
But after that, learned that I yearned for purpose
As you worked against the way my circuits were wired
Deep inside of me gave me fire
And something that I can work wit
Wantin 100 percent of my personality to urgently seize reality
Ready to burst if this enemy I burned wit
Was just a tease never to be released

Becomin the best you, bar none

Idiosyncrasies and secrets keys to your kingdom
Or castle, the hassle and strife that life brings
Gets balanced out by good times or nice things
The frightening tight strings of life start to loose
Allowing your kite to fly high like wit true friends
It's stupendous, the rainbow of emotion you feel
Everything from pain to love, hope and more
Opportunities, open doors
Opens your mind eye, to find what you're hopin for
Is it around the corner? Waitin to be seen
Destiny or success to some degree seems
Like this would satisfy that endless appetite inside
For which you sacrifice it all
It calls you answer but it always sends you back for more
Cause you never give it what it askin for
(You ever notice that it always sends you back for
More cause never give it what it's askin for)

You thrive on the desire inside you
Strive to arrive on time due to life's design
While you're minds tryin to find


As sweet as life is, it's just as short
And it seems like time is up just as you're
Starting to get the hang of the language of love
And things can never remain the way that it was
We long for timelessness, maybe if our accomplishments
Ever delivered what they promised if
Life pleasures were everlasting then I'm admittin
This might bring God some competition
But everything is short-lived; forget about fortune forgive
The sportsmen and the actor slash rapper, entertainer
For makin us think that money can sustain us
They're things in life that money can buy
For everything else and empty shell inside
Ask the rich man, right or left?
Wit which head do you carry your treasures to the life after death?
And if he has and answer, I'll man up and
Stand up in Time Square wearin a pink pamper
If a pink panther, can follow clues and solve cases
Then I know that you can all trace this
Everything from family to employment
Is all given to us for our enjoyment
But our job is to find life and define life
Without going outside of our God
This drives you, each day that you survive through
Life is designed to guide you to Him from day one
Wit each step you come closer to or further away from

What drives you, what makes you feel so alive
You thrive on the desire inside you
Strive to arrive on time due to life's design
While you're minds tryin to find"

And if your plants won't grow, where you planted them?
What will you ask of them?
They already know what you know
Thinking fast and sinking slow
We've been here before


This is the floor of the ocean
Nothing deeper (Deeper)
There must be someone here who knows how to breath in
I lost my senses like I've lost so many times
Why do the answers seem impossible to find?




Thinking fast, sinking slow
Wе've been here bеfore but now


Everyday feels like a rematch
Between what I know and what I hope for
And every day I know a little more
But you always notice when
I'm on the ropes again

(From city to city, coast II coast)
I make rappers see more stars than Space Ghost

So the poet cracks the Moet while they drink the Old Milwaukee
Off the hook with (droppin visions) so the Leo of the trio
(Without the sexy voice) scoops more hoes than Theo
So I dedicate this rap to all my ghetto spokesmodels
Dressin like y'all paid, redeemin Coke bottles
So nod to the oddness as the story gets told
While I burn these MC's like Rotisierrie Gold
Cause you know the reputation of the L-I-K-Ses
The crew that wets you with they beer until somebody undresses
I bust my shit and peel! Grab my wheels of steel
If y'all niggas can't feel me than y'all niggas ain't real
I hit so hard the WBC
Called to ask me could the champ come and train with me
Cause my liquidatin flows transpose on niggaroles
Individuals, close they eyes, cause I blurred they visuals
And I'm about to be as large as Houdini in a minute

I never take falls, I got more balls than pre-hauls
I flow without flaws to scrape all you sucka paws
Never ever find the fool that stole my brew
(I'ma do mean, terrible, nasty things to you)
Don't lose me, I make a rude boy say excuse me
If you choose the real shit you can't refuse me
Ask your grandpap I bust the dandy rap

I think you ain't busy since Red was in seas
You need to put a little more thought into your writin
Your style is Virginia Slim, while mine is Phillie tightened

So stop biting what your mouth can't chew
A nova eat you but my DJ flow better than you
But when I go to set it call the closest paramedic
Cause you faker than that motherfuckin jewelry that's cosmetic
So hold on to your seats while I rock these beats
Cause these are just the repeats of our amazing feats
Cause even Kurtis Blow knows we break beats like world records

STRATGIA FAMILIA,Bohemia,rap,"Comrades:There are times in the life of peoples. there are moments and minutes that are extraordinary:  and a minute, a moment of this kind has come now, a tragic moment, a bitter moment which we are not experiencing here today.

Before anything else, I want to make it clear that we are not overcome here by passion today:  I want to make it clear that we are once again looking at a people capable of looking the facts in the face with valor, a people who knows how to analyze the situation calmly, a people who does not listen to lies, a people that does not give itself over to pretext, a people that does not base its opinions on absurd suppositions but on evident truths; and so the very first thing we must do is to analyze the facts.

It was yesterday afternoon when we were all busy doing our work: the blue collar workers, the civil servants, the government officials, the members of the Revolutionary armed forces and the students; in other words, we were all busy, working on our great tasks which we have ahead of us; and then suddenly a gigantic explosion shook our capital.  Because of our instinctive concern for penetrating to the roots of problems, we here who were working on our jobs at that moment immediately were concerned that something serious might have happened either in the electrical power plants or in the San Ambrosio section, or perhaps on a ship tied up in the harbor; we thought that this must have been explosives that had been planted in the capital early in the morning; but, like a kind of premonition, we imagined something serious had indeed happened; we thought that that explosion, regardless of where it occurred, must have been producing disastrous consequences and that we would have many victims, unfortunately, and this is actually what happened.

You all know what happened during those minutes of profound pain and anguish—although not of fear—throughout the city.  First of all there was the reaction of the people.  The people were not frightened by the explosion: the people rushed to the explosion; the people were not fearful; instead, the people were full of valor even though they did not know what had happened; they went and they came from here and from there, the workers, the militia men, the soldiers and the other members of the public order forces they all came ready to give aid to the extent that they could.  And the event could not have been more tragic:  the ship, which had been tied up on the pier, suddenly blew up at the very moment when they began to unload the cargo; half of the ship virtually disappeared and along with that all of the workers and the soldiers who were busy unloading the cargo.

What was the cause of this explosion?  Many people certainly asked themselves this.  Was it an accident?  It is possible that all those who have no experience or knowledge in the field of explosives might have thought of the possibility of an accident.  People know that explosives have a habit of exploding and it is easy to imagine that they can be set off very easily; however, this is not the case.  In reality, it is not easy to set off explosives:  you have to take certain specific steps in order to set off theses explosives.  And so, what was this all about?

The other possibility was that we were dealing here with sabotage—but what kind of sabotage?  How and where?  Could this act of sabotage have been carried out in the presence of many people?  Could this act of sabotage been carried out in the presence of Rebel soldiers and port workers, at high noon?  And if it was sabotage, how was it carried out? first of all, why was it sabotage and why was it not an accident?

What did this ship carry?  Well, it carried ammunition and it also carried large numbers of antitank and antipersonnel grenades.  The rifle ammunition was already on the pier and there was no more rifle ammunition left on the boat.  This ammunition had been carried in the stern hold, in the last division of the hold, that is to say, at the bottom of the hold, and the port workers had taken it all out.

This left a higher compartment, which used to contain the refrigeration holds but which had been converted into a storage hold for the rifle grenades.  The explosion did not occur while the men were handling the rifle ammunition; the explosion occurred at the moment they were unloading the 30 tons of rifle grenades in crates.

If there was no fire on that ship—because an explosion can occur during fire on board—and if there was fire at all on that ship, could the explosion have occurred if one of the crates, for example, was dropped and hit the deck?  First of all, it is not probable that any of these crates fell because the workers knew what they were handling and it was not the first time that these stevedores had been handling this kind of cargo; explosives and supplies had been handled in the port of Havana for many years and, as far as we remember, there had never been any kind of explosion.

The workers had spent many years handling this type of cargo and they knew how to handle it; they knew just exactly how to do the job, how to put the net down so that no box would fall or be bumped; and they were of course extra careful because they knew that this was material intended for the defense of the revolution; this was not the first time they had been doing this kind of job; they had done this in the past, free of charge, on a volunteer basis, without earning a single penny, as a contribution to the defense of the country.Conclusive ProofIn other words, those workers knew what they were handling and it is not probable that any of them dropped any of these crates; but even if this remote possibility had occurred, even if this probability had occurred, that would mean that a crate of grenades would explode if it is dropped.

Now, can a crate of grenades explode if it is dropped?  Well, the manufacturers of these supplies—especially when we deal with one of the best munitions factories of the world—of course fully aware that these crates are going to be handled by men and that it is therefore necessary to take the utmost precautions; and so it is practically impossible for one of these crates to explode during unloading or handling; now, on the basis of my wartime experience, I can say that the most that could have happened would have been for one of those grenades to be set off but it would not explode; this is because that grenade was of course not mounted on the rifle; to fire that grenade you have to mount it on the rifle and they you have to fire a special cartridge; now, that takes a very strong impact, but in this case of course there are no safety devices because you want to fire it at that time; however, in this case, there were safety devices and the grenade could not go off by hitting anything; the one thing I never heard was a rifle grenade that exploded while it was still mounted on the muzzle of the rifle.

All right, in what way could a grenade explode if the crate in which it was contained were to be dropped?  Now, are these grenades shipped without any safety devices?  Are grenades simply stuffed into the crates and then shipped?  Are productions shipped without any safety precautions for those who handle them, precautions for those who load and unload them? You have to try to figure out how many times these crates are handled, from the factory until they reach the place where they are to be used. Could anyone believe that something could go wrong, in other words, that there could be an accidental explosion, in view of all of these safety precautions?  I can assure you that this is totally impossible.

However, theory is not enough here; and so we ordered the necessary investigations to be conducted; this morning I ordered Army officials to take two crates of grenades of various types, to put them in an airplane and to drop them from 400 and 600 feet, respectively; so here you have these grenades (he shows two samples to the public) and they were dropped from an aircraft at an altitude of 400 and 600 feet; the crates, these are the grenades here—these crates weigh 50 kg, that is to say, you have a hundred pounds dropped from 400 and 600 feet; these are exactly the same grenades that were on that boat.  Is there any reason to assume that they could explode when they are dropped 8 feet, with all of the safety devices on these grenades an in the crates—here is how these grenades fit into the crates—in other words, the crates which were hardly damaged when they were dropped from altitudes of 400 and 600 feet; and in addition to that you have to figure the speed of the aircraft; and so, these crates, when dropped, penetrated several feet into the ground due to the impact; the wooden crates were destroyed but not a single one of the 50 grenades in the crate went off?  I am sure that this test could be repeated a hundred or a thousand times and the grenades would not explode because the explosives, to be set off, must be intentionally set off; during the war, bombs were dropped many times and they did not explode; they were the ones that served to supply us with the explosives with which we made the mines we used; I do not remember a single case in which any of these weapons went off by accident; you always had to do something very specific to explode them.Sabotage Outside CubaSo, in other words, this could not have been an accident.  It must have been intentional; we have to discard all possibility of accidents and we must accept the only explanation; an intentional explosion.  But how? How could anybody carry out an act of sabotage in the presence of Rebel soldiers, veteran Rebel soldiers, who were present during the handling of this cargo?  How could you have an act of sabotage in the presence of the workers who were working there?  If all possible precautions are taken during such operations, how could you possible assume that anybody could perpetrate such an act of sabotage, in the plain light of day and in the presence of workers and soldiers?  That somebody would have had to be first of all a worker and it is utterly illogical for us to expect an act of sabotage from a worker because the workers—and there is no doubt about this—are fervent and determined defenders of our revolution; now, these are not just theories, these are not just assumptions, and we must therefore analyze this possibility of sabotage.
First of all, all of the workers are registered and they are registered to make sure that they will not carry matches or  cigarettes with them; they are registered in order to make sure that they will not commit some act of carelessness; and that is not all, they are not only registered, they also have a delegate who watches the work that they are doing.  In other words, not only are they registered, but they are also observed by soldiers and by their own delegates and their own comrades. This makes it virtually impossible for those workers to carry out an act of sabotage under such conditions; moreover, these workers are well known by their comrades; there are not many of them, maybe 12 or 18, who can do this kind of work at any one time; and in this particular case the number was much smaller and everybody who was working there was certainly well known to everybody else.  And here is another important circumstance:  the workers who were working there were not notified in advance that they were going to be assigned to work on that ship.

The ship arrived early in the morning.  The first shift ran from 1100 to 1300; they were not working in the compartment with the grenades; they were handling the rifle ammunition, in the lower hold.  They worked from 1100 to 1300 hours; when they came to report for work, they simply arrived at the port and then they were assigned to their ship; they never knew in advance which ship they would be assigned to because there is a roster of more than 1,000 stevedores; so they might get assigned to any boat.  The second shift got its ""tickets"" at 1230, and they were supposed to start working at 1300.  Those workers, who constitute a small group out of more than 1,000, did not know that they were going to unload those explosives.  In other words, we cannot assume that this was a premeditated thing, a planned thing, in other words, we cannot assume that this was prepared because preparation under these circumstances would be too difficult.  In other words, you would have to have a fellow who could somehow guess to which ship he would be assigned and on what day, one man out of a thousand, in other words, he would have to guess in advance that he would be assigned to unloading explosives.  Now, he would have to have everything ready; he would have to fool the very watchful soldiers and he would have to escape the vigilance of the delegate and then, with all these precautions, he would have to carry out an act of sabotage; these are impossible conditions to produce so we can say that these workers who were going to unload these weapons for the defense of their interests and their rights are absolutely above suspicion.  In view of these points of moral conviction, on the basis of this very careful analysis, this extremely detailed investigation, on the basis of detailed conversations with all of the port workers and stevedores who were there at the time, we have arrived at the conclusion that this act of sabotage could under no circumstances have been carried out in Cuba.  The explosives were in Cuba but the mechanism which caused these explosives to explode was not installed in Cuba.  The mechanism that caused the ship to be blown up could under no circumstances have been put in place in Cuba.  And so we must analyze the other possibilities:  Could it have been the members of the ship's crew? Very difficult to answer, very improbable because we have interrogated them one by one and we very carefully interrogated the personnel who had to do with the holds, with the cargo, and with the keys; but first of all, the personnel who had the keys, who opened the holds on that day to start the unloading—they died in the explosion.  The ship's officers were on board when the explosion occurred.  And we certainly cannot imagine that anybody could blow up 30 tons of dynamite in a ship and then escape unharmed.  Many crew members were able to save their lives but this does not mean that nobody could possibly have blown up 30 tons of explosives in a boat and then get away with his life.  Only 4 out of the 36 crew members were absent: 3 cabin boys who left after they has served the meals to the crew, and one oiler who was not on duty.  In other words, only 4 people were absent at that moment, for absolutely logical reasons.  The others were inside the ship, including two passengers.  It is therefore improbable that this job was done by any of the crew members.The Fact in Logical PerspectiveAs we continued our investigation of this act of sabotage, we arrived at the conclusion that the act was prepared far away and certainly not in Cuba; we further figured out that it was very improbably that it could have been carried out by any of the crew members and we also thought that we would be able to run this thing down through a very careful analysis of the cargo and the loading operations in this case.

Over here, in Cuba, we were extremely watchful and careful because these were weapons in which those soldiers and workers were very much interested.  Here we know the enemies we may have to deal with.  Here we are extremely careful.  But what about the situation thousands of miles away, in a country where they are not familiar with our problems, in countries that are not threatened by acts of sabotage or explosions, in countries that are not stirred by by revolutionary convulsions or by counterrevolutionary manipulations, in a country such as Belgium, which was the point of departure?  Over there, in those countries, would it have been as difficult as here to perpetrate an act of sabotage?  Our interrogation of the ship's officer who was responsible for the cargo told us how the goods were loaded in the presence of that officer; when he was not there, another crew member was present—although in this case his identity could not be precisely determined.

Of course, under loading conditions, it was much easier and much more practical to introduce some kind of detonator that would blow those explosions up.  And this is why we concluded that we would have to look for the sabotage agent not over here but over there, abroad; we figured out that we would have to look for him in a place where it was much easier for him to carry out such an act, to prepare an act of this kind.  In other words, there was one indisputable fact, one proven fact, and that is this: After they had moved out more than 20 crates, they moved or began to move the remaining crates, that is to say, they moved one of the crates that were next and then came the explosion.  When the workers were handling a new crate—after handling more than 20 before—when they were handling one of these remaining crates, the explosion occurred; now, that explosion could not have been an accident: that explosion must have been intentional. In other words, the movement of any of these crates released the detonator mechanism which in turn produced the explosion.

Now, in greater or lesser detail, we know that there are very many procedures for putting over this kind of trick with explosives which are used very much in wartime; you pick up a pen or pencil or you move a chair or table and suddenly there is an explosion; it is technically perfectly feasible to put any of those mechanisms between two crates or under one crate and the moment the crate is moved, the explosion occurs.

Now, how were these crates stored?  They were stored in compact rows; they could not move by themselves, in other words, the cargo is wedged in, with one crate wedged against the other in the hold, in such a way that the crates could not move.  In other words, there was no space left for any movement.  A system of sabotage, such as this one, can be installed without the slightest worry that the explosive might go off prematurely, in other words, this can be timed very carefully to coincide with the unloading; and this is actually what happened; after the first few crates had been removed, somebody moved another crate, perhaps somewhere around crate No 30, and then the explosion came; we demonstrated before that this could not have been an accidental explosion and that it must have been prepared; this is so because these cases were not along the first to be moved.  In other words, the crate that set this thing off was in the second or third row of crates and any object that was placed there could have been seen at that moment; but it was at the very moment one of these rows, one of these crates, were moved that the explosion occurred.Known EnemiesThis is the conclusion at which we have arrived; it is not an arbitrary nor an emotional conclusion; it is based on analysis and on the evidence; it is based on proof and on the investigations which we have conducted, including the experiments which we had conducted in this connection; first of all, we conclude that this was sabotage and not an accident.  And that I am sure of; nobody should doubt that because—what else could have caused it?  Millions of tons of explosives are transported all over the world each year and we have no reports about ships being exploded; here, in Cuba, we have been shipping and handling explosives for many years and we have never had any news of any kind of explosions.  Of course, we remember the Maine whose mysterious explosion nobody has ever been able to explain perfectly well; this turned into a cause of war because the nation to which that ship belonged arrived at the conclusion that this must have been an act of hostility on the part of the supporters of Spain; this was true even though that country could not carry out any investigations here, even though they could not do what we did here, even though they could not interrogate anybody and talk to the workers or crew members; they could not conduct this investigation here and so they arrived at the conclusion that the cause of the explosion was an external mine and they declared war on Spain because the United States concluded that this was an act of hostility directed against the United States from Spain; and so, without any further proof, without any arguments, on the basis of a simple assumption, the United States declared war on Spain.  But we did not want to abuse our imagination that much; we did not want to jump to any unfounded conclusions; and it was even more illogical to imagine that Spain, at that time, considering the difficult situation it was in, would have wanted to cause trouble by blowing up a United States battleship; that, at that time, certainly was most illogical and we certainly had more reason than anybody else to believe that this was sabotage.

Now, who are the international forces that support the enemies of our people and our revolution?  We certainly have every reason to think that there were certain interests that did not want us to receive these arms; we have every reason to know who these groups were, these interests that did not want us to have these arms; we certainly did have reason to assume or to think that we know who promoted this kind of sabotage, in other words, none other than those who were very anxious to prevent us from receiving those goods; whom should we think of as the author of such an act, if not those interest groups that do not want us to receive those explosives?

Now, this is one issue we have to talk about.  Those who are interested in preventing us from receiving these explosives are the enemies of our revolution; they are those who do not want our country to defend itself; they are those who do not want our country to be able to defend its sovereignty.  We know the efforts that have been made to prevent us from purchasing these arms and United States government officials were included among the major groups that were interested in preventing us from receiving those arms.  We can say this without revealing any secrets because if these were secrets, then they would certainly be the kind of secrets that everybody knows about; besides, it is not we who say this; the British government said it, the British government declared that the United States government was interested in making sure that we did not get any aircraft from Great Britain.  The United States authorities themselves said that, their spokesmen indicated that every effort was made to prevent arms from being sold to Cuba.

We have been fighting against these pressures, we have been fighting against these obstacles.  And so you have a situation in which a country, a government, using its tremendous international influence, takes a step in diplomatic circles to make sure that a small country, a country which as to defend its territory from its enemies, a people which has to defend itself from the criminals who want to come back, from the colonizers who want to perpetuate slavery and hunger, we have to fight against these pressures from a powerful and influential government which is trying to prevent us from getting arms.  And we can say that so far we have been successful in getting a government, a European arms producer, acting with independence and firmness, to oppose these pressures and they sold us the weapons.  In other words, the Belgian arms factory and the government of that country have resisted these pressures, not just once but several times; the United States Consul, the American Consul in Belgium and a military attache at the United States Embassy in Belgium have been negotiating with the factory and the Ministry of Foreign Relations in an effort to get them to refrain from selling us these weapons.Where We Have to Look for the GuiltyIn other words, officials of the United States government have repeatedly tried to prevent our country from getting these weapons.  And the United States government officials cannot deny this reality; in other words, they cannot deny that they were interested in making sure that we would not get any of these weapons; and among those interested parties we must look for the guilty ones; among these interested parties we must look for the guilty ones who did not want us to have these weapons; that is where we must look for the culprits because we have the right to think that those who through diplomacy tried to prevent us from getting this equipment, could certainly have tried to achieve the same objective by other methods.  Now, we are saying that they did this exactly, because we do not have convincing evidence; and if we had it, we would present it to the people and to the world; but I do say that we have the right to think so, to think that those who failed to prevent us from getting these weapons by one method could certainly have tried other ways; we have the right to think that the criminals must be found among those interested in preventing us from getting these weapons; we have the right to think that those who caused the loss of Cuban lives, yesterday afternoon, were interested in preventing us from getting these weapons.

First of all, what right does any government have to interfere with the efforts of another government to defend its sovereignty?  What right does any government have to claim control over any part of the world? What right does any government have to prevent Cubans from getting the weapons which all other peoples are getting to defend their sovereignty and integrity?  What people do we want to prevent from arming itself?  What arms purchases are we interfering in?  What obstacles are we placing in the way of any nation that wants to arm itself?  And who would think that a people, a government living in peace, a nation whose people who live in peace with other people, a nation that lives and maintains diplomatic and friendly relations—or relation that should be friendly—has the right to interfere to prevent that nation from getting arms?  This is especially true if we keep in mind the fact that the country in whose name that government is acting is acquiring strategic raw materials from our own country which they need for their defense—and we are not interfering with their acquisition of these materials—we are not interfering with the efforts they are making to defend themselves, we are not interfering in their affairs.Manifest Interest in Forcing Cuba to YieldWhy do those interest groups not want us to obtain the means for defending ourselves?  Do they perhaps think that our country should once again fall into the hands of the criminals who ruled the country for 7 years?  Are they perhaps promoting the return of the big criminals?  Or, something that is even worse, are they perhaps trying to invade our soil? That is what they would try to do if they do not want our people to have the means for defending themselves, if our people is not supposed to constitute any threat to that country, and our people is no such threat nor could it ever be, nor could it ever be a military threat to any other country, our people could never develop offensive potential against any other nation because the strength of our revolution all over the world does not reside in its military force but rather in its tremendous moral force, in the tremendous example it sets for our sister nations, for our blood brothers who are enslaved and exploited throughout Latin America, because our force was never a military force; we are militarily strong enough to defend ourselves but we are not strong enough nor do we ever want to be strong enough to subjugate or attack anybody.

We are indeed strong enough to defend ourselves because defending your own soil is something different, it is a right, it is one of the rights which the peoples know how to defend against any power and against any force.

We will never be strong enough to attack anybody; not only because we will numerically never have enough weapons nor men nor resources but also because we would never have the right to attack anybody; and this is why we would never be strong enough—even though we may have the resources and the weapons—simply because we would not have the right to do this.  On the other hand, we do feel strong enough to defend ourselves, we are sure that we are strong enough to defend ourselves because we are defending a right and we will know how to defend this right.

All right, why don't they want us to have the necessary means? Very simply because they do not want us to be able to defend ourselves; they want us to be defenseless.  And why do they want us to be defenseless? So that they can force us to yield, so that they can subjugate us, so that we will not resist their pressures, so that we will not resist the aggression.  And do the authorities of a country which has been unable to prevent its territory from being utilized systematically to bomb us—do those authorities have any right to prevent us from acquiring the means we need to defend ourselves?There Is No People to People Hostility in UsTomorrow, perhaps, the dailies in that country will come out, saying that an analysis of these truths and reasons constitutes an insult to the people of the United States and they are going to try to say that we are insulting the people of the United States; but we have never insulted the people of the United States; they say that these truths are insults and they call this an insult to the people in order to try to create the impression that our people is against the people in the United States; and the reasons with which we argue with respect to the rulers—who are responsible for the policy of that country—these are not insults to the people because, on the contrary, we know exactly who is damaging the people of the United States and we know that it is those men who make mistakes such as these; those who offend the people of the United States are those who are making mistakes like this.
To reason, to call a spade a spade, to explain these truths to the people—this is what they are trying to describe as an insult because they want to create trouble between these two peoples; but there would not be any difficulties between these two peoples here because Cuba will never have any people to people difficulties with any people of the world.  The peoples are good and you cannot judge them by their rulers; it would not have been fair to judge the Cubans, that magnificent people, on the basis of the rulers whom the revolution defeated; the peoples have not guilt in this way.  But it seems that we Cubans have learned to tell the truth without fear of anyone, on this continent.  And the truth is that aircraft hostile to our people, aircraft piloted by criminal mercenaries, take off from the United States and that the government of that country, which is so concerned with preventing us from getting arms, has been unable to prevent those flights.

After 7 years of cruel struggle and tremendous sacrifices we have guaranteed victory for the people.  During those days, any citizen was liable to be tortured, any citizen could be assassinated in the streets of the cities or in the rural areas; the most atrocious tyranny ruled our country; but that was not an obstacle for ships to arrive from the United States, loaded with bombs, that did not prevent ships loaded with machine guns from tying up in the harbor of Havana—without getting blown up. But we did not assassinate anybody; we did not torture anybody; we did not beat up a single human being; we have established in our country the rule of respect for human dignity, for human sensitivity, and our revolutionary government has been characterized by that climate of security which gives the citizen a felling of tranquility and security and which is based on respect for the citizen; we do not torture anybody, we not assassinate anybody, and still, the weapons that are shipped over here to defend our system, are blown up in the harbor.  On the other hand, the weapons for the torturers of our people, the weapons for the jailers of our people, the equipment that killed 20,000 of our compatriots, the equipment that was used in killing students and peasants and workers, in killing men and women, in killing professional men and any citizen—that equipment was received directly and that equipment was not blown up.A Democracy That Aids the CriminalsWhen it comes to a just revolutionary regime, a humane revolutionary regime, a regime which has tried so hard to defend the interests of the people, the interests of our suffering and exploited people, exploited by the landowners and the privileged groups—ah, yes, the regime which has liberated the people from all of these injustices, the regime of the majority of the country, the humane regime—yes, when it comes to that, they fight against it.  But the criminal and inhuman regime, the regime of the monopolies and the privileges—that they supported.  We don't want the kind of democracy that helps the criminals and the exploiters!  This is democracy here, where the human individual counts, and were the human individual will always be worth more than money.  For money we will never spill a single drop of human blood; for money, for egotistical interests, we will never sacrifice a single drop of human blood.

These facts are well known.  Why should we then be astonished when a ship blows up while it is being unloaded in the port?  Why should anybody be astonished over an act of sabotage that costs worker blood?  Who would be astonished over the fact that an American aircraft, coming from United States territory, flown by United States pilot, carrying a United States bomb, tried to drop it on a factory with more than 200 workers?  And on that occasion I said:  ""What would have been the grief of our people today and what would have been the tragedy of our people if, instead of the corpses of those two mercenaries, we had to bury several dozen workers?"" And as if I had a premonition often, here we are today, burying several dozen workers and Rebel soldiers.

And who should be astonished that the criminal authors of this sabotage were not concerned with the safety of the victims they have thus cut down, the men whom they have assassinated?  And who would be astonished that they would do a thing like that, barely a month after they had dropped a 100-lb bomb in the middle of a busy factory, in the middle of more than 200 workers?  What is surprising about the fact that we very calmly addressed the people and used the evidence to explain this event to the people, that we exhibited the proof and that we told them to send technicians so that they could see for themselves that we were telling the truth, and what is so strange that a week has passed and still nobody has been arrested in the United States; yes, a week has passed and a month has passed and they have not expelled any war criminals from the United States, they have not found anybody guilty, they have not bothered anybody; on the contrary, a few days ago those little airplanes came over again and, barely a week later, they bombed the locality where the Prime Minister of the Revolutionary Government resides.

In view of all this, is it so strange that they should try to blow up a ship full of workers—especially if they planted a bomb on a sugar plantation, in a sugar refinery, and especially since they were not at all concerned when they bombed an area where there were children, dropping 100-lb bombs on that occasion?  What is so strange that they should publish yesterday, in the magazine Bohemia, photographs showing the air fleet which is peacefully resting on North American airfields without anybody bothering it?  And what is so strange that we received a notice yesterday to the effect that Jose Eleuterio Pedraza was in Washington?  What is so strange about all of these things happening the way they did?  Well the only difference is that this time this has been a hard blow and it caused blood to be spilled.Combination of Counterrevolutionary InterestsIt was quite logical.  The other time, we had to go through the hospitals full of victims, a consequence of that invasion, several months ago, yes, several months ago, and the author of that invasion is still free to walk the streets of the cities in the United States without anybody bothering him.  What is so strange about a series of actions demonstrating the combination of powerful interests that are rallying against our revolution; that only a few days ago large quantities of corn were delivered, to take the place of molasses in making alcohol; that a few days ago we withdrew the inspectors who were watching the planting of fruit and vegetables which we exported to that country; and everybody is familiar with the law through which they tried to threaten our country with refusing to buy our sugar?  In other words, in a few days they are going to present a bill in Congress by virtue of which the President of the Republic would reserve for himself the right, at any moment, to take our sugar quota sway or to reduce it or to buy no sugar at all if he deems it necessary.  Now, what does that mean?  It means that our country has a very weak economic structure.  But why does our country have a weak economic structure? Because that was the structure which the foreigners devised for our economy, a single-crop economy, a big estate economy, the economy of an underdeveloped country, a weak economy due to the policy of the foreign owners of our economy over a period of 50 years.

And, now, exploiting this dependence which we want to rid ourselves of, exploiting this situation which we try to shake off—and this is what economic independence really means—exploiting that dependence, they want to adopt a system through which they want to try to deprive us of our rights and our sovereignty.

This means that while we try to implement laws here and take measures here that would benefit our people, they can arrogate to themselves the right to kill our people though starvation.  In other words, exploiting the economic advantage which they have as a result of the single-crop and big-estate policy, the policy of underdevelopment which they have been pursuing here, they try to restrict the rights of our people to act independently and in a sovereign manner and they do this through the threat of killing us with starvation.  What does this mean if it does not mean an economic Platt Amendment?  What does it mean if not a warning that if we do take measures against the big estates, against the monopolies, measures to benefit our people, they will adopt reprisals against us because we are a small country with a weak economic and if we make an effort to strengthen our economic, they threaten us with hunger and starvation.  What is this if not an intent to downgrade the sovereignty of a country, the intention to restrict the independence of a country?  What is this, if not a case in which one government claims the right to decide the destiny of another country through reprisals?  These are not measures taken to defend national interests, they are not measures taken to defend the interests of the people of the United States, they are not measures taken to guarantee the supply of food.  No, these measures are taken quite in contrast to our measures which we take in order to defend the people, in order to defend the national interests; our measures are not reprisals; the measures which they take are reprisals and their measures are not intended to defend any national interests, they are reprisals against our country, while the measures which we take are taken in defense of our national interests and the interests of the people; none of the measures which we are taking are measures intended to kill the people of the United States through starvation.  At most, we take measures to restrict the tremendous profits of some of the United States monopolies but we are not in any way restricting the substance nor the work opportunities of the people of the United States.  The measures which we take are intended against the monopolies, against the monopolistic interests, not against the people of the United States.  And the measures which they take are not measures designed to defend the people of the United States; they are reprisals against the Cuban people.Military Maneuvers—What For?Of course, it took a revolutionary government to proclaim this; it took a government of the people to proclaim this; it took a government without fear to proclaim this; a government without fear of threats or reprisals, without fear of military maneuvers.  And we were able to say: military maneuvers in the Caribbean—what for?  Landing maneuvers against positions occupied by guerrillas—what for?  Airborne maneuvers, involving offensive operations—what for?  Well, we have learned that the problems of the world are going to be discussed at the Summit, as they call it; we have heard that the problems of the world today are problems of guided missiles, of advanced technology; but we have not heard anybody say that the problems of the world are problems here in the Caribbean and that there are international difficulties here in the Caribbean.

We understand that the big powers today do not think militarily, in guerrilla terms; but those who had to use the guerrilla techniques were we, to fight against that professional army of the tyranny, and that we had to use this tactic against numerically superior forces with better equipment.  But I have not heard anybody say, anybody in the world, that military questions will be discussed in guerrilla terms.  And as we watch these marine corps maneuvers, these counter-guerrilla landing maneuvers, we must ask ourselves what for and why.  Are they perhaps thinking—I ask myself—of making a landing or are they just trying to intimidate us? Are they trying to frighten us?  Are they trying to get the idea across to us that we can be invaded at any moment?  Are they trying to tell us that there are various possibilities and that landings here constitute one of these possibilities?

Who said that anybody would land here?  And who said that they could land calmly and peacefully here?  We Cubans are strong enough in terms of patriotism and civic pride and they ought to know that these insinuations cannot frighten us.  And they are talking about a lot of possibilities but I would like to say that were are highly astonished at the calm way in which they say that they are going to send the Marines here—among one of the possibilities.  As if we did not count all!  If we Cubans would just stand here with our arms crossed, doing nothing!  As if we Cubans would not resist any landing here, any troops that might land here with the intention of subjugating our people!

It is a good thing for us to say this once again, right here and now, as we gather to bury a considerable number of soldiers and workers and citizens who yesterday were alive, as we are today.  Who knows how often we met with them, in the factories or at public meetings, or in military installations:  Who know how often we met with them in zones of operations:  And who knows how often they applauded, as you do today, full of like and noble illusions which the revolution has awakened in each and every humble Cuban:  Today, as we come here tearfully to lay them to rest, today as we do this painful duty, we know that tomorrow it may be us, just as it was they yesterday; and just as it was others before them—because we Cubans have learned to look death in the eye calmly; because we Cubans have acquired a very realistic view of life; we believe that life is not worth living if you do not live it fittingly, if you do not live it with justice, if you do not live for something, especially something as great as the Cubans are living for now.We Are Determined to Defend OurselvesHere, in this ceremony, before these dead, a result of this assassination, we want to say once again that we are not afraid of any troops landing in this country; that we will not hesitate once second to take up our rifles and to occupy our posts, that we will not hesitate, regardless of what foreign troops might land on this soil; that we, that is to say, the Cuban people, our workers, peasants, and our students, our women and young people, our old people, the children—none of us will hesitate to occupy our positions calmly and without any fear; and we will do this any day any foreign force may dare land on our beaches, regardless of whether they come by boat or by parachute or by aircraft or any other way.

And it is a good thing for us to say this without any bragging or boasting, like people who are really determined to do what they promise. And certainly nobody can doubt that yesterday was one of the worst days, perhaps the worst, that we could ever have to face.

Anybody who watched the people yesterday, anybody who witnessed that episode, anyone who saw how the multitudes advances toward the fire, how the soldiers and the workers and policemen and the Marines and firemen and militia advanced, how they all advanced toward that place of danger, how they advanced toward that place of death—without hesitating.  Anyone who saw what the Cubans did yesterday; anyone who saw the soldiers, people advance toward danger in order to rescue the injured, in order to rescue the victims from a burning ship, in a zone that was on fire, when nobody knew how many more explosions might occur; anyone who knew of these waves triggered by the explosions, killing more people, not in the first but in the second explosion; anyone who say how the people behaved yesterday, anyone who saw the people direct traffic; anyone who saw the people establish order; anyone who saw the people advance toward that explosion which created a tremendous roar, a roar reminiscent of nuclear explosions, anyone who saw the people advance toward that roar without knowing what it was all about—anyone who saw all this can be sure that our people is a people capable of defending itself, a people capable of advancing even into the roar of nuclear bombs.

So, this is what happened yesterday.  This is not an invention, a fantasy; it is a reality which the whole nation witnessed; it is a reality which we had to pay for with dozens of valiant lives, the lives of men who died trying to save their comrades, men who gave their lives readily and calmly to save the lives of others, others amid the twisted shell of that ship or in the rubble of buildings; firemen who advanced without hesitation to put the fires out in buildings full of explosives.  Anyone who saw scenes such as those yesterday, anyone who saw a people so dignified and so manly and so generous and so honest as our people—anyone who saw this has the right to know that this is a people that knows how to defend itself and that will defend itself against any aggression.
if only those who think that they could invade our soil would come to realize the monstrosity of their mistake—because we would then all save ourselves many sacrifices; but this, if it should unfortunately come about, if they should indeed attack us, then we do not want to leave the slightest doubt that Cuba and the people of Cuba would fight to the last drop of blood; we would fight to the last breath.  We will never attack anybody; nobody has anything to fear from us; but anybody who attacks us should know quite clearly that the Cubans of today are not the Cubans of 1898 and 1899; this is not the beginning of the century; we are not in the 1910's or in the 1920's or 1930's; the Cubans of this decade, the Cubans of this generation, the Cubans of this era are not the same—not because we are better but because we have had the fortune of seeing things much more clearly, because we have had the good fortune of learning from the example of history, learning the lesson of history, which cost our ancestors so many sacrifices and so much humiliation and which cost past generation so much grief; we have had the good fortune of learning that lesson, so that this generation will fight, if they attack us, to the last drop of blood. We will fight with the rifles we have, we will fight with the rifles we can buy, we can buy from anyone who sells them to us, very simply and very plainly; we will fight with ammunition and with the weapons which we buy, the best we can get and those that we take from the enemy, those are the weapons which we will fight with.Alternatives Still the Same:  Liberty or DeathUndeterred by threats, undeterred by maneuvers, remembering that once upon a time there were just 12 of us and that, compared to the force of tyranny, our force was very small and insignificant, so insignificant that nobody thought we could last, we nevertheless did resist and we therefore firmly believe today that we can resist any aggression.  Not only will we resist any aggression but we will also crush any aggression and so we once again have the same alternative as we had when we launched the revolutionary struggle, the alternative of liberty or death; the only difference is that now liberty means something more, now liberty means the fatherland and our alternative, our slogan should therefore be:  fatherland or death.

And so it is good for us to remember these things on a day such as this, a tragic and painful day for the people, a painful day for the government, a painful day for the victims and the dependents of the workers and soldiers and the citizens who fell, at a moment such as this, an important moment.  We are prepared to resist not only militarily. Perhaps they think over there that we are brave enough to die but that we are not tough enough to resist privation.  Indeed, men are valiant enough to resist even those privations which we can least imagine; and if those men who began the struggle in the mountains, had not been tough enough to resist all of these hardships, then they would certainly have lost; but this was not the case because they were tough enough to resist all of these hardships.

Weak men are men who are not tough enough to resist hardships; strong men or women are those who are tough enough to resist hardships. And a people that is valiant enough for any sacrifice in combat must also be brave enough to withstand any hardships; those who believe that they can defeat us through economic reprisals must be proven wrong.  And at this point I must say that it is better to be hungry but free that to be enslaved and have all you want; it is better to be poor but free, even though this may cost us dearly and even though we may have a long road ahead toward the development of our resources—someday we will also achieve that goal—but it is much better to be poor and free than to be rich and enslaved; we were slaves and we were poor but now at least we are free even though we are poor and someday we will both free and rich.Against Exploitation and ColonizationNobody can buy us off with economic advantages, especially since nobody here ever had a chance to enjoy these economic advantages before—because the vast majority lived in misery, injustice, and exploitation.  Just remember the hundreds of thousands of children who did not have schools; remember the miserable slums; remember the slack seasons when people did not have work; remember unemployment; remember the agony in which we lived!  Here in Cuba, our people have done nothing more than to fight against these evils; the only thing we have tried to do is to overcome these evils; we have only reclaimed what is ours and the only thing we have done is to defend what is ours.  And in the eyes of the international plutocracy, this is the mistake Cuba made:  defending what is hers, defending what belongs to her people, against exploitation and colonization.

And this is why the airplanes come over, this is the reason behind the increasingly more audacious insolence of the criminals who are protected by that plutocracy; and this is the reason why—at a time when ships are not blown up anywhere in the world, at a time when there are no airplanes bombing anybody anywhere else—the workers in our country are threatened in their own homeland by 100-lb bombs or they are threatened at their place of work by bomb explosions; this is the cause for the tremendous hatred of the oligarchy; this is the cause for the conspiracy against our fatherland.  We understand this very well because it is true that we understand our problems; we know how to understand these truths; and we must proclaim these truths; similarly, those interests and those conspirators must realize whom they are dealing with and they must realize that they have no business making plans—aboard—to solve the problems of Cuba or to work out solutions; this is no time to hatch counterrevolutionary plans against our country; this is true first of all because they have to reckon with us and if they do not reckon with us—because they do not believe that we are strong enough—well, then let them face the consequences!

Today we are gathered at a very sad time but nevertheless this is one of the strongest moments for our fatherland, one of the most symbolic. Who would have told us 14 months ago—when we were marching through these streets with our Rebel soldiers from Oriente, marching through the streets amid the delirious joy of the people, that the day would come when we would have to march through these same streets amid sadness and grief, seeing these same people, on our way to bury a group of workers, a group of those soldiers who marched through here, carrying the standards of national liberation!  Who would have told us that those who caused the assassinations of so many thousands upon thousands of Cubans and the accomplices in these crimes, who would have told us that they would force us once again—and who knows, how many more times—to come together and to bewail our latest victims, our citizens who have just been wiped out by the same criminals and by the same allies!  But, bitter though it may be, one thing is certain:  we are carrying out this very painful duty here today and we will carry it out as many times as it may be necessary.  We will do this duty, one day in the cortege and the next day in a coffin, if necessary!  We will do this duty because we know that others will follow those who fall, that others will stand up after those who fall.The Ranks Will Continue to MarchOur losses have been great over the past 14 months:  wonderful and unforgettable comrades are no longer with us, men who have been with us all these past years, comrades who have disappeared from our ranks doing their duty; and still the ranks keep marching on, the people are on their feet, marching, and this is what really counts!  It is certainly an imposing spectacle to see a people marching, like our people!  And we witness a magnificent spectacle today as we march together!  A few years ago, it was just a dream, a dream of seeing all of us marching together like this.  Who ever would have dreamed of someday seeing the worker militias march side by side with the university militias; side by side with the soldiers of the Rebel Army; shoulder to shoulder with the members of the Navy and the police; shoulder to shoulder with a column of peasants wearing their characteristic sombreros; their ranks compact with military-looking, rifles on their shoulders; poor farmers from the mountains who today accompany us at this moment of grief, so that nobody will be without representation, so that ministers and citizens can mingle together here today, so that the entire nation can rally in a spirit of combat and heroism!  Who would have dreamed that someday military men and workers would no longer be enemies, that someday the military and the workers and students and peasants and people would no longer be enemies; who would have dreamed that someday intellectuals would march arm in arm with the laborers; who would have dreamed that someday the men of labor and the men of war would march together, as they marched today!  In the old days, they marched separately, they were enemies, and the fatherland was full of dissimilar interests and dissimilar groups and dissimilar institutions; and today the fatherland has one single feeling, the fatherland is one single force, the fatherland is one single group; today they do not fight each other, the peasants and the soldiers or the students and police or the people and armed forces do not die, fighting each other; today the same spirit and the same aspirations spring from the people and the military and they all have the same cause; in the past they fought each other but today they fight side by side; in the past they marched on different roads, today they march together, today they fight together, the workers and the soldiers; today, they die together, helping each other, giving their lives for each other so as to save other lives, as inseparable brothers.

This is why our fatherland today looks stronger than ever before, this is why today our revolution looks more solid and more invincible than ever before and this is why our people today looks more gallant and more heroic than ever before; and so this blood was spilled, the blood of the soldiers and workers, the blood of the Cuban workers and the French workers, that blood was spilled together, the French workers who, in doing their duty, also died while transporting these goods which will serve to defend our sovereignty; and this is why we have not forgotten, today, to help our people and to provide support for the dependents of the Cubans who died here; but neither have we forgotten those French workers who were killed in this explosion, by the enemies of the workers, here or anywhere else in the world; French blood was spilled yesterday and this brings to mind the cry for liberty which was raised by the first great revolution in modern history, the first great revolution of mankind; and so the blood of the French workers and the blood of the Cuban workers was spilled together; and since we do consider them to be our brothers, we have decided to provide aid, as a gesture of generosity on our part, for their dependents because they too have wives and mothers and children; to us this was a very basic act of solidarity because we are a generous people and we feel this kind of solidarity toward all peoples of the world.Cuba Will Not Be Intimidated and Will Not RetreatToday I have seen our fatherland more glorious and more heroic; today I have seen our people more admirable, more worthy of admiration, the way you admire a column returning from combat, worthy of identifying itself with those fighting men, fraternizing with those fighting men the way fighting men do after a battle.

The important thing is not the gaps in the ranks; the important thing is the spirit of those who remain on their feet.  Not just once, but many times we have seen gaps in our ranks, in the ranks of our armies; we have seen painful gaps, such as we see them today in the ranks of the people; but the important thing above all is that the people as a whole stay on their feet.

And as we say farewell to our fallen heroes of today, the soldiers and workers, the best way I can think of to say goodbye to them is to express to them the idea which symbolizes this struggle and which symbolizes what our people is today.  Rest in peace, all of you; all of you workers and soldiers, rest together in your graves, as you fought together, as you died together, and as we are prepared to die together.

And as we lower you into your graves at the cemetery, there is one promise that applies to yesterday and today and tomorrow and always:  Cuba will not be intimidated, Cuba will not retreat; the revolution will not stop, the revolution will not retreat, the revolution will continue advancing victoriously, the revolution will continue to march irresistibly!

And this is our promise, not to those who have died, because to die for the fatherland is to live, but to those comrades who will always be in our memories as something that belongs to us; they will not be in the hearts of just one many, but they will be ineradicably in the hearts of a whole nation."

I start my journey empty-handed
No map and no bag and no cash and no plan it's
Suffocating to a boy that's tryna man shit
The top gunner
Wanting some of what he got none of
Seems his biggest hold-up is that he's scared shitless
Need some bravery but just doesn't know where to get it
Where can you get some courage?
And how much does it cost?
I even saved some money up doing some odd jobs
But it's never enough, they say it comes from within
It's not about what you got but what you're willing to give
And he ain't got a lot so what is really the risk
Stopped raining on his paradе and stormed up to the king
And he hеard em say


You got the courage to come up here
For that, i give applause
But just resistance to fear
Doesn't mean that you're strong
You're not prepared huh
You're not prepared
Saying you are not prepared huh
You're not prepared
Lone wolf huffing and puffing
Like you got nothing to lose
But when it's time for you to fight
What will you use?
You're not prepared huh
You're not prepared
Saying you are not prepared huh
You're not prepared
You might also like
And so he tossed me out i couldn't even fight against it
Hated that feeling of helplessness when i'm defenseless
A ragdoll bouncing off the asphalt
Couldn't even hold my ground and it's all my damn fault
That's when he grew an obsession with the need of having to win
Swore to the sky won't ever let it happen again
Eyes lit ablaze, blinded by the rage
Mind in a state of disarray
Killing everything in his way
Doesn't matter who are or what you having to say
Cus it's eat or be eaten you're simply food on his plate
It's that brute force method
That do more reckless
He's ready to try again
Charged ahead at his nemesis


I see you got some power now
Some physical improvement
But it's brain over brawn
Foolish don't how to use it
You are not prepared huh
You're not prepared
Saying you are not prepared huh
You're not prepared
You got the knowledge of war
But hold none of the wisdom
That's why you're still poor
You think there isn't a difference
You are not prepared huh
You're not prepared
Saying you are not prepared huh
You're not prepared

And so he lost a second time left battered and bruised
He fought without strategy no tactics or rules
He fought without a purpose except for wanting the throne
He was sick of being lower than the king all he knows
Is what he lived through thinking that the grass is always greener
The cash grows on trees and the trash is always cleaned up
Royal features that the people would kill for
He had so many overthrow chances that fell short
One thing was that unsure was why the king spared him each time
Sent away with some lessons why'd he care for his life
The man put arms up then placed his sword on the ground
Looked directly at the king and leaned forward as he bowed
And heard


I 'm hoping that you understand
I hope that you can see
That this will never end
There is always more to be
You are not prepared huh
You're not prepared
Saying you are not prepared huh
You're not prepared
This courage, power, wisdom
Experienced just a sample
The path to enlightment's
Just a fight with your shadow
You are not prepared huh
You're not prepared
Saying you are not prepared huh
You're not prepared"

Stay calm and patient, we gon’ make it to our destination
Condolences to those taken in the conflagration
I suppose they’re awaiting us now, I make ‘em proud
When I’m out, do me that favor and play it loud

Utilize the line to rebel
Find a mass of others with like minds in the swell
Reminiscing over this and it ain't hard to tell
Now my daughter knows Geo’s bars, my heart swell

Double if the seed takes – rapid expansion

Keep in mind ‘fore you slide deep and opine
We’re in the six hovel with picks and shovels told to coal mine
Struck and found a diamond on a practice swing
Now the scouts all tout him as an athlete
Respect for the game, sincerely revere the spectator
The kind I often find training to be the next player
Run the drill out – blood, sweat and adrenaline spill out
But faith you won’t ever be without

Utilize the Line to propel you
Through the parts where the sharks swim around in the swell
What, you thought we haven’t fought ‘em off? Sit for a spell
I’ll spin a yarn about a thousand battles won by the swell

You had your hand on my heart, didn't let me in
Cards up my sleeve, but suit didn't fit
And I see the new guy that I know you're getting with

Turn the lights out, gotta leave now
Gonna drive there, just so i can see how

The 49ers,I Wish,rap,"Verse 1: Jas Mace
People always asking me why I'm so quiet (why)
Cause I don't talk much maybe you should try it
But then I hit the stage, and they're amazed at the switch (uh huh)
It's like a magical trick, matter fact that's what it is
It's a lyrical gift that don't exist (don't exist)
In most of y'all genes like a button fly, no need to wonder why
It just is what it is, get it while you can
Before it disappears like the youth of your kids
And my oh my time flies faster than
C3P and Skywalker hitting mach speed
Don't get it twisted like Tec's locks be
No Sherlock can stop me Holmes, pop a lock like Ozone
What you see is what you get so
What you get is hip-hop from the heart yo
Lift your glass up high until you tip so
Grab a goddess B, and start this Odyssey like Calypso

In the garage wack emcees in the trunk space
I really wish that y'all would let me let the skunk blaze
In peace, and quit trying to untie your gags
While we're taking shots I'm pouring vodka on scabs
I wish it didn't come to this, but see it did
I should have seen you was a snake since we was kids
So what the hell, I wish you well

Jedi Mind Tricks,Those With No Eyes (interlude),rap,"I, I who have nothing...

Verse I: Ikon
Intersections in real time
The unbroken circle and dimensions of the mind
The tie that binds
The eternal tie that defines
The vanity of my insanity in due time
Will shine
Like the night seas under the moon
The haunted corners of familiar rooms
Yet i'm consumed
With vanishing into thin air
The realization that this shit is my cross to bear
So where
Did I think I could run away to see
The people that decided to leave without asking me
But we
Decide to wait for happier tomorrows
And find someone so they can be distractions from our sorrow
But my distraction's the books and paper that I scrawl in
I'm eloquent as summer breeze and leaves that have just fallen
I've crawled in a corner hoping all of this will end
With the knowledge that love is just another word for revenge
I who have nothing but the comfort of my sins
I who have nothing but the comfort of my friends

Verse II: Ikon
As I decay, demons prey above me like a vulture
Ability to endure contradiction is a high sign of culture
Verbal sculptures, self defacing
It is not God or lunacy that I am facing
But the erasing of the purity and passion of my words
The herds of cattle babble on with talk of the absurd
But I preferred
To walk away from all the feuds
To find my life is more confusing than a rubics cube
So I'm subdued
In all my words of verbal prods
To live alone one must be an animal or a God
But it's official
All of my pain is clear as crystal
The natural side of life has now been seeming artificial
But I can hit you
And rest assured that I'ma last words
I could give a fuck about ya secrets and ya passwords
I get past words and their ability to hurt you
Patience is a virtue and knowledge is a commercial
I who have nothing but the pain that I've referred to
I who have nothing but the pain that I've referred to
Chorus
Verse III: Ikon
Lost among the miracles, I stand alone
And have grown into a being that's sitting on top a throne
I've known
For many years that I would turn to rust
I find a reason for another breath
Before my return to dust
I become one with science and mathematics and the rising of the sun
I'm numb
To all of those who blind and cannot see
The chastiser of the enemy
Perception requires duality
Inspect your soul, the color of coal inside the body
I have hardly, come across them who's holy
Send them to the chairmen to control thee
Burning of the sun and frigidness of the cold
The battlefield is new but the war is now old
You can never see the merest shadow of a halo
Above the head of evil djin who's deadly like tornado
The world has become an aquarium
Full of gaping fish with murderous smiles
I on the other hand stand on the outside looking in
Writing down murderous vows
I who have nothing but the lack of variation
And I who have nothing but chains and suffocation

I took a piss on my nut sack and called it Jack Black
It's a fact, I got more rhymes than Zack Braff taking a nap
I attack motherfuckers wearing purple backpacks
And I snack on towel racks and take a shit on your track
Yeah, you're wack cause everybody understands what you say
But when I get on the mic, I make milk out of clay
And I play air guitar with a tube of toothpaste
And I say, ""Karate pencil case"" and put it on tape


Yo, I'm MC Insecure, what's up
I really don't think that I'm good enough
To be rhyming on this track cause my lyrics suck
All my verses fall flat like a hockey puck
It took me seven months to write the first part of my verse
And now I got nothing left, so I'll pretend that I got hurt
Ow! I think I sprained my ankle. You guys just go ahead and finish the song without me


Yo, MC Amnesia up in this, bitch
Woke up five days ago lying in a ditch
Didn't know who I was, I couldn't remember shit
Apparently something happened that was traumatic
I used to have more rhymes, but I can't remember them
Seriously, I'm freaking out, I can't remember anything

Yo, I'm MC Gets Side-Tracked Easily
My rhymes are badass like Gandolfini
You know, he's known for The Sopranos, but he's also in movies
Like Get Shorty and Terminal Velocity
Which I really didn't like because I don't like Charlie Sheen
Well, I guess in Hot Shots he was kind of funny
But I prefer Leslie Nielsen in The Naked Gun
You know who else was in that movie? OJ Simpson
Which is kind of weird, knowing what he did after that
Wait, what was I saying? I think I got sidetracked


Yo, I'm MC Lethal Weapon 1, 2, & 3

Though I agree that it is a groundbreaking trilogy
The four was also good; they added Chris Rock and Jet Li

There we go! Thank God I brought a change of clothes

Yo, I'm the emcee with the final verse
I'm supposed to sum up everything you heard
But motherfuckers, I don't really have the time
So fuck that, and come back to the chorus guy


I'm still singing the chorus (Thank God we're almost done)
I hate singing the chorus (It's such a boring fucking job)
I'm gonna take my 40 bucks (That's what they're paying me)
And I'm gonna go get really drunk (Masturbate, then go to sleep)


MC Amnesia: Wait a minute...I remember what happened now! You guys raped me!
Everyone: Uh, yeah, we did. We raped you
MC Amnesia: Wha--no wonder I couldn't remember anything, you...I thought you guys were my friends. That is not cool!
MC Doesn't Know What Irony is: No, it's ironic!

You are my star-ship come take me up tonight, and don't be late



Hi um, my names is E'Z, I'm here through confidence
I just wanted to tell yall, I'm a love addict and I'm tryna find a way to get over this
But Imma tell yall my story today



So what we waiting fo, you pick the place to go
This love is ecstasy, don’t let the police know
Cause baby I’m addicted and you’re the hustler
Your loves a drug and I’m your number one customer
So light it up girl and I'mma take a hit
But I'mma do it slow so I can savor it
Never to much, I never get enough
But I’m addicted so I’ll never gives this up
People say I need to start rehabbing, detox from you and start relaxing (What?)
I just tell em they can all go to hell, and in-hale more of you cause I’m loving your smell
Love in your eyes they do not deceive me, love is blind and I’m feeling like Stevie
This drug is dangerous and I knew from the start
I’m on first class flight headed back to your heart
You might also like(Chorus)

If I should die before I wake tell em it’s the Love drug that sealed my fate
Tell em it’s the Love drug that sealed my fate (And don’t be late)

Tell em it’s the Love drug that sealed my fate (And don’t be late)



Yeah, I’m just a man of confliction
Who would have thought that love would become my addiction
I can’t picture ME if YOU ever go missing
You can write a song to my heart beat, just listening
I wanna love you, can you show me how?
Get me love drunk, I’ll never sober down
I'mma love-a-holic and proud to admit it
Faithful to your drug, to your heart I’m committed
Swear this gotta be destiny, love lockdown you cardiac arresting me
If you serving someone else than me, end of story I'mma make em have to rest in peace

Here I am, and I am right on time
It was a couple years ago when I made her mind
Did it real smooth, I ain't even have to drop a rhyme
But her I guess I might drop a couple dimes
Love is so rare sometimes we forget to grab it
Falling for the wrong chicks man I swear its such a habit
I'm savage but this girl wasn't just average
I seen her walking by and I knew I had to have it
Not talking sexual, I'm talking bout her heart
Cause beauty's skin deep and this a perfect place to start
Temptation all around but I gotta play my part
Cause if I want this thing to work then I gotta play it smart
My mind and my heart, now they in the same place
And our souls, are running at the same pace
Mistreat her mislead her, that's a lame case
Her star-ships coming, I won't be late

(Chorus)

If I should die before I wake tell em it’s the Love drug that sealed my fate
Tell em it’s the Love drug that sealed my fate (And don’t be late)
And If I should die before I wake tell em it’s the Love drug that sealed my fate
Tell em it’s the Love drug that sealed my fate (And don’t be late)

'Bout to get fitted, you know that I'm a mack right?
Reached up on the shelf, snatched up my all-black Nikes

All black Girbauds with them razor sharp creases
A black t-shirt, jet black beanie
Oakland on the front and bitch no you ain't seen me
But believe me, I keep all these hoes starin'
Hoop in a nugget in my ear 24-carat
So admit it, I'm fitted from the flo' up
It's nineteen ninty fro' but I still sport a low cut
Tight fade with a all-black outfit
You doubt this, and I'ma' have to knock you out bitch
I might bust you in ya' face if you jockin' me
And I keep my gat just in case animosity
I come from way back and I don't play that
I say raps and remember that I stay strapped
So what you lookin' at? It's me and my potna' Diddley
I'm ready to bust and plus I got my chopper wit' me
So settle down, don't get to juiced up
Cause pooh-butts get faded like a crew cut
And what I'm packin' ain't nothin' like a sling shot
But it breaks hot, and it got seventeen shots
So Ant Diddley won't you cock that Glock back?
Don't get 'em bucked there's no chance they'll try to pop back

Baby are you the type to be with someone like the devil
Because you're my Wah and Only
You're my Wah and Only
Now I'm not so lonely
Because you’re my Wah and Only



I remember when the two of us met
When I was walking through the streets of the city, mad at the world, thе hat I was wearing blew off my head 'causе outside it was windy Man, it was pissing me off, was in a puddle, getting muddy and stupidly drenched
Bent over to get it
Before I could pick it up
Somebody else with a beautiful scent
Got it for me she was Truly a 10
Rockin' body looking cute in a dress
In the moment, nothing else was important
For just a minute, wasn't plotting revenge
She was perfect everything that I dreamt
But look at me, I'm perilous and a threat Especially to princesses, I'm a menace, you can see right me, but we could still mesh
Took her to dinner, ha.. romantic
She got lemon water then ordered the salad
I got the All You Can Eat, just left and never paid the damage
We hit the club.. she sip a martini, she making it last
But I be thirsty, so I'm hopping the bar And I'm drinking beer from every one of the taps
We get in the gym... she on the elliptical listening to Zen, and being all spiritual
While I'm banging out to heavy metal, lifting heavy metals, I could pick up the building too
I'm trying to keep it cool, cuz when we in public Everyone's Jaw dropping but the Cat calling got my claws out, I'm a Jaguar when you get spotted
I took her right back to the mansion Both of us sat on my mattress
Put on a movie, got through the first scene, now it's me that be getting the Action
Tryna get freaky with her so I hand her a paddle, ask her if she wants to slap it
I said I'm sorry baby, do you like it aggressive? She said ""you couldn't imagine""

Back at the restaurant, her order was extra long, plate after plate, chicken and steak
No silverware and she was eating it raw
The chef is in awe but she was still hungry Started munching on the on the waitress arm Ate the candles and the tablecloths
All the decorations and the menu's gone
She wanna stop into a biker bar
She walked directly to the Bartender
Demanded every type of hard liquor
Cuz She a regular and large spender
She playing Pool with a cigar in her mouth Challenged everyone to arm wrestle
Then they cut her from the alcohol, so she put a bottle to somebody's temple
Who am I with?
…
Cause it ain't no princess
She can outlift the Olympics
Look at that Fitness
Both of her biceps are bigger than Hogan's 24-inches
Handle my business, now when I'm giving a whipping, she insisting on assistance I gotta stop it early like I'm Herb Dean Put a dude in critical condition
All of these kinks will never be worked out, though I'm out in multiple positions
I'm even strapped down, while she wearing this black outfit, with a rope that she gripping
I'll admit it, I'm a little bit twisted, cuz I've lived a Pitiful existence
In my life, I had nothing to lose, but now I do because you walked up in it


I know I'm a rebel

Back of the headshot, dawg (dog) on his face like a Snapchat filter
I could've killed him in the first, that's just a drill
My first battle against Saynt was at The Bunker
We in Massachusetts, this battle could've been at Bunker Hill
And when it's real, y'all can tell, y'all can see it in his eyes
Yo' turn, see if you can make niggas believe them lies
Nigga time

Where I'm from, gang bangers get shot in they face tat'
Say Jack, what y'all praise now-a-days is fuckin' astonishin'

I didn't take it well
So I got a gun shorter than your time yo' tellin' ass stay in jail
You wasn't cuttin' up vatos, you a beta male

Every Fucking Bar


You do realize, I'm a gang banger, and I be in front of the camera everywhere I go
So I would've got killed, if a nigga like me would've told
I ain't gon' lie, I prayed every night, I was glad I got out three weeks
Last time I did damn near more than three weeks in the hole
Now that's facts
But check this out, befo' I started runnin' shit
I used to run and shit
Prayin' shit go sour like Warheads
I'm talkin' fuck rap, we goin' straight to a bank lick
Headin' to the vault like Cortez
Oh yeah, real rap, I was a straight jacker
For the right price I would've got ya bitch boxed up
For that Green I was a bae (Bay) Packer
You a straight actor, Denzel
You battled ICE and that Harlem nigga, gave you a Big L
But them shells, I'm dumpin' 'em out
It's crazy how all these niggas sound like Charlie Brown teacher wit' a gun in they mouth
What the fuck is he 'bout?
I can teach you some shit, give you some free game
When there's mo' than 30 in the clip, nigga you don't need aim
I've been shootin' since a youngster, they was prayin' that we'd change
But ever since adolescent, all my enemies got shot down like bad suggestions
I've mad aggressive, can't no slackin' with killin'
Matter a fact, I be really fuckin' hatin' this feelin'
Sometimes I be wishin' it was actually different
Cause I got mo' dead homies than homies that's actually livin'
But look, yeah man that's some shit you had to live it man
Talkin' seein' bodies laid out like a business plan
And the streets where death come (cum) quicker than a minute man
I'ma shoot 'til it jam, or click like the call waitin'
The doc said, ""What happened to all them shells?""
The Dawg (Dog) ate it
Y'all hatin'
You block niggas on Twitter? You a hoe fo' that
Got this big ass gun wit' the pole attached
I ain't even want this battle, I was gonna skip this wack hoe
Instead, I'ma shoot him {claps} and stand over the body 'til I know you're clapped
AK wit' the shoulder strap
I'm on some west shit
All my guns, the serial (cereal) scratched off like the grocery check list
Vet shit, nigga stop frontin'
How a nigga gon' tell me how not to get shot, ain't never shot nothin'?
You just be talkin', you got battle rap guns
You can't tell a nigga how them Glocks feel
Bitch I done seen niggas duck behind trees tryin' not to get shot and they got shot still
Every fuckin' bar, they got shot still
I'm talkin' they on the ground still movin'? Fuck it, they got shot still
I ain't got chill, I've been livin' every line
I've been faced to face with death, that bitch look different every time
And I am not lyin', this nigga ain't never gettin' it like us
I be havin' to go to the cemetery just to be around niggas that I trust
Aye my dawg was playin' basketball, 30 plus points he was averagin'
Schools was reachin' out, 'bout havin' him
His brother was on some different shit, got 30 years in prison
Goin' from facility to facility just travellin'
Ironic though, one of them was a shootin' guard the other was stabbin' 'em
But y'all can keep havin' him
Because he walk like he black, talk like he black, it's obvious he wanna be a black guys
See that's the part that make me chuckle
Cause even if I beat his ass and gave him two black eyes
He still couldn't see our struggle
And when it's real, y'all can tell, y'all can see it in they eyes
Make niggas believe them lies
Nigga time


I said dawg, who wanna brawl?
Now I'm beatin' on ya cousin', I get the boy in blue buried, shit leakin' out his muffin
Where my 80's babies at, y'all hear me beastin' on the youngin'
I get the cookin' and bug out, like a creepy crawler oven
I'm thuggin', who said I wasn't
Smack his head with the Rum bottle
Only attachments in my life is for the gun nozzle
Trust that, this west coast cat don't want squabbles
These right hooks will have you rappin' like Young 
I stuff hollows and grease the barrel so the shells greasy

{Stumbles}

Hold the torch just for sports like a jail TV
Strapped where ever I'm at, y'all better tell Geechi

What did I say? I just said that shit


""Like a jail TV""


Appreciate it
I bust the torch just for sports like a jail TV
Strapped where ever I'm at, y'all better tell Geechi
It's not too far from the stock holmes (Stockholm) like Helsinki
He fell easy
The gun squeezin', give me one reason
I put in pain wit' the blade, keep stickin' 'til his lungs wheezin'
It ain't a game, if I say he Twitchin' that mean his blood streamin'
It's uneven, you really never was elite
Named yourself after John Gotti, so I can tell he was a geek
Cause I traveled to yo' city and left legends at my feet
But even the best in the west wanna be accepted in the east
Y'all sweet
This ain't a lemon/lime candy, Geechi Gotti the mob boss of the petty crime family
I send a thousand rounds at Compton, I bet his men don't want it
Go loco, my YG will give Slim 400
Run it
That's how I does it, y'all gon' get bro hurt, know that
If we both strapped, I let my shit go first
Talkin' slick to a slick talker, how that shit gon' work?

I'm ready to air it out on all these niggas, I can see 'em runnin'

I'm really the baby, she know that her youngest son was always guaranteed to get the money (Okay, let's go)
She know that her baby boy was always guaranteed to get the loot
She know what I do, she know 'fore I run from a nigga, I'ma pull it out and shoot (Boom)

My junior popped him and left him lopsided, yeah, yeah
We spin his block, got the rebound, Dennis Rodman
Fool me one time, you can't cross me again
Twelve hundred horsepower, I get lost in the wind
If he talkin' on the yard, the pen' dogs'll take his chin
Maybach SUV for my refugees
Buy blocks in the hood, put money in the streets

Had it on me, thirty thousand, thought it was my last day

Mister D,Look in My Eyes,rap,"He will be a perfect dream of manhood
He'll be everything and more a man should
Tender as a flower
He'll look like Tyrone Power
That's all I want of Mister Right

The year we wed, he'll make a million and retire
Then we'll lead a life of mad desire
He'll be part of me
I'll be part of he
It will be love at first sight
The day I find Mister Right

He'll father me and mother me
And sister me and brother me
And in his arms he'll crush me
And constantly mush me

And he won't mind if I spend all his earnings
Long as I'm releasing all my yearnings
He will live for me
I will live for he
And we will live every night
When I have found Mister Right
You might also like(spoken)
Yes! I know that somewhere in this wide, wide world there, there is an ideal man for me. And he will awaken me and complete me. 

With Mister Right I'll never have to explain a thing. He'll always know. We won't have to say a word to each other for years! If I'm upset because I, I had trouble with the saleslady in the lingerie department on the second floor of Gimbels, I, I won't have to tell him. One look in my eyes and he'll know I had trouble with the saleslady in the lingerie department on the second floor of Gimbels. 

And, and when I make little mistakes, as whom doesn't? He'll always be kind and understanding. If I give away all his new clothes by mistake, he'll smile. And, and when I break his razor shaving my legs, oh, he'll only be amused. Yes, yes, that's Mister Right. My darling, my darling Mister Right. 

(sung)
Oh! the moment that we meet I'll tumble
Ah, I'll see him and I'll start to crumble
He will say hello, and boom! inside I'll know
At last I've found my Mister Right

He'll take my hand and bing! My every thought will scatter
Then my heart will give a zing and shatter
Bells will start to ring
Ting-a-ling-a-ling
And we'll get married that night
Bang! When I will have Mister Right

He'll make not one mistake, he'll be solid good
Just like I dreamed he always could
Not ever sweet or arty
But strong and Bogarty

One look and I will feel I'm in a cocktail shaker
For I'll know that I have met my maker
He'll have no match
So on him I'll latch
The moment he is inside
That handy, dandy, dreamy, screamy man
Mister Right!"

Rhema Soul,Spotlight,rap,"K-nuff verse:
This time i'll keep it simple
Figured i'd do you a favor
No blemishes or pimples
I am proactive with flavor
It doesn't matter if you're grown or you are a teenager
This here is meant to hit you harder than ali did frazier
The darkest night is hopeful when it seems
I slept and woke up in a dream
I feel like a celebrity in this here moment
Now when i stand they notice every kink, sponges i'll soak up everything
Leaches won't leave you anything but broke and lonely
The lights and cameras on me flickering
Ultra bright reds
Feel like they're seeing my darkest secrets and my white heads
Yeah that's sort of nasty, but if you just focus you can see
An open book, i'm full of war like them novels from clancy
Some might call me panzee, some look to harm me in alleys
Others got armies and ammunition they're targeting at me
Whether you hate me or fancy, love to debate or attack me
I am still standing here gladly, making a statement, no plan b

Juanlove verse:
My...vision is hazy at best, but conviction makes me restless
Or...maybe i'm crazy at best, and wearing my words like necklace
Carving a space like lumberjacks so brave i mess with texas
Or i'm martin scorsese at best, with pictures that make you breathless
Under the flashing lights, but... still just on the verge of reckless
Truthfully i've so much soul, and this much soul leaves a man headless
See buddy holly said that the sky belongs to the stars
I then converted this truth to bars and realized i'll never need a lexus
Life in abundance never the man seeking to hold a death wish
Maybe, i'm patrick swayze at best, but, even my ghost is deathless
Truth is i'm trying to stretch this, so ease up off my checklist
I'm fixed upon the surface, and hope floats just like a dead fish
So, pardon my rhetoric this poetry is like post modern tetris
Maybe i'm just a builder at best, and just nehemiah gets this
All prophets are hated like diseases and tetanus

Make me a 'mil and done it before the deal
Them other boys lyin, Slim Thugga speak the real
Candy paint shinin, 5th wheel reclinin
Caddy goin topless, like them dancers at The Diamond
Boss, yea blindin, everybody lookin
And where I'm from, women ain't the only ones cookin
Boys gettin paid, pushin Caddy Escalades
Still roll Vogues, used to roll blades
??? braids in the phase, when we reppin for our side (Northside)
And you ain't ridin slabs, if them ain't swangas on your ride
Ready for whatever, if you think Thugga scary
I'll unload the Glock, if it get necessary
Been legendary in the streets of the H
Cause I stay ridin 4's, puttin candy in your face... mayne!

Ay I gots ta work my wood grain wheel

This drink got me leanin, I ain't smoke all day so I'm fienin
I'm feelin like I'm livin and I'm livin like I'm dreamin
My candy slab gleamin, I pass with a flash
Smashin the gas, ??? boyz on glass
Swang like I'm bout to crash, then I hook the other way
Make my slab sway, down here that's how we play
Ridin down that MLK, chunkin dueces to that Trae (Where you at, Trae?)
Niggas on the grind mayne, boys is on they J
I got diamons on my collar, shoes say prada
Shades say the same, I'mma kill them on them mayne
While I'm workin wood grain, I'mma Hogg on the road
I make 'em move around, like them laws on they roll
Trunk steady hummin, you hear me when I'm comin
Beat hittin hard, soundin like a drummer drummin
Everyday I stay stuntin, ain't gon' to stop 'til I'm dead
On the Northside we ride blue, not the red

Ay I gots ta work my wood grain wheel
Ay I gots ta work my wood grain wheel
Ay I gots ta work my wood grain wheel
Trunks steady bumpin, grillz steady comin
Ay I gots ta work my wood grain wheel

Hope it’s not fact

All beginnings gotta end
And every time we falling out
I feel it’s all ending again
Wanna know just how you feeling

But I can give myself to you

Raised in the streets raised with elites

State known for beef
There ain't no clearer speech in the way I tell it
Put on CD's tapes and wax cover it wrap and sell it
And if you sellin prevailing in a state known for twistin melons
187's funeral processions
It ain't no tellin who's the next to fall off
So I stay real never cross the game
Cause it's a shame when those in the wrong state of mind
Lose they name
In Sac they live in a strange
And in the V it's like boom-boom-boom-boom-boom
They ain't playin
All I'm sayin in the Rich it's off the hinge
Don't be ridin through chillin if you ain't folks with close kin
Speaking on all men who think the West ain't shining

Mac Moose:

California raisin blazin and grazin off good grass and hash
Strapped g in the stash pass the blunt and let her pass
Like my jig's with ass
See thru like glass
See like smashed
Heard your main girl had a blast
Me her young moose and bags
Filled with prophalac's
No cognac cuz Cali raised me from San Francisco baby (?)
My block C-A-P grew up with boss hogs at the mountain top
Caddy's, Jag's and drops slam the door and click the locks
Ridin come non-stop
Nothing but shocks and old schools on big blocks
CH (?) cops spotlight shining from the chops
Trying to get off rocks
While you drop trying to set up shop
Governmental plots place more blacks in
Prison cells than jobs
Lucky moms and pops who were here to steer me clear
From the death and fears
Locked in San Quienten for years with fears
Forced to face my fears from Frisco to SV football cheers
Know that it's a mirror that helped to get me here
Step from the rear to the front hit a fat ass blunt
So hey do what you want
Indo pass pop your trunks and cock your guns

Hook


Mac Moose:

Been different countries and went state to state
First class trips to make
Make more money so I can escape
But ain't no place as great
From Northern Cali to the L.A. stars
To find menage a trois
Hoodrats with no bras
Come with big bodies
Felons got more scars
But never pause cuz Cali got me goin
Asian, black, Samoan, Latino, Persian, blonde hair white snow
And some of y'all ain't knowin we be flowin in these Cali streets
Known for packin heat from the Sco down to Long Beach
Jungle of concrete is what you meet
When you step off the plane
Colors, 'caine and gangs

Very versatile see the way we raised is buckwild
Hit a buck get out the way before
We tear a chunk up out your chest
Cause chops penetrate through vests
Who can you ask about the West or how it is in Frisco
Ask the Badboy camp, DJ Quik plus Nas
And they don't know
Yeah this the home of bolos not homos
It's filled with a bunch of crazy sets
Not a rapper trying not to give the set too much promo
Because our sets are full enough as it is
This not the place to raise your kids
Hella trips to Lewis and Ribbs
They took him young
Put him in the casket from the crib
From PH, HP, Lakeview, the Blackhole, SD to the Mission

I gotta chill yeah and pace myself
Hold up and don’t try to race myself
Slow down and just take my time
And be able to wake up the next day and say that I’m fine
And I’m going to live my life with the greatest
Happiness I could find with nobody trying to say shit
And try not to give them a reason to trip
Stop by smoke some good weed and  I dip

And I don't hide nothing each line something resides fuck a disguise it's like
The whole world can know
And I'll just let it be, you do you homie I'm trying to be a better me



Born and raised by two separate mothers
Never loved another like the second cuz the first shit never heard from her
I didn't discover I was different till they slipped and called me a nigga
It figures had to develop to get the picture
But now it's clear as day, when I was younger my mother would say
Though not in this home skin tone can take away
From what you deserve so just learn to be bold and grow old
Well mama just know I bear my soul so

So engulfed in moonshine when she passed due time his plan was to run
I understand it was fun and wasn't meant to last
But a man is not what happens what makes a man is how he reacts
Adapt, shit don't bitch up I've been in that position
When you slip up and she fill up only you wound up missing
In a town of strangers she had me, and I'm glad see
The fact that you were never my dad made me a man and see



The whole world can know
And I don't hide nothing each line something resides fuck a disguise it's like
The whole world can know
And I'll just let it be, you do you homie I'm trying to be a better me



If I don't have this I got nothing left in so much debt I'm bout to break
I hate it when someone tells me they ain't bought a CD in years
Like what the fuck my peers have jobs and families
I can't even make a dime off of my soul I bled on these
Pages and it's been ages since I've seen the silver lining
Despair is piling up, the industry's declining
And it seems within my dreams within my sea of hope is capsizing
Rap's dying with no plan B I laugh crying


The whole world can know
And I don't hide nothing each line something resides fuck a disguise it's like
The whole world can know
And I'll just let it be, you do you homie I'm trying to be a better me



At least my girl loves me and she treats me like a king
And well I guess as much as ends don't meet I wouldn't change a thing
The lack of funds and stress is better than being depressed
It's a long way to the top but shit at least I'm taking steps
And that's more than I can say for most of you
I'm supposed to do what pleases me not just settle for whatever comes easily
And see it's he who be the one to decide his fate
No hand outs man success is something you gotta take cuz see

Mass of Man,Unhappy,rap,"Lock the door, shut the window, turn the lights low
Achieving happiness everyday is a life goal
Stuck inside a mind state I can't escape from
Never understood why this is what my brain does
Love it or hate it, I was born with this depression
Compulsive with my obsessions, my mind is a lethal weapon
It's overbearing; my mind is tearing the pieces
I've been fiending for some dopamine; like an addict, I need it
Yeah I need it, I want it but don't receive it
What is the point of life?
I don't understand thе meaning
Am I dreaming? I've been staring at thе ceiling with my eyes wide open
At nighttime I'm screaming
People don't notice how bad it truly is
Until they stand around your casket with a basket full of gifts
I'd rather be dead than alive and unhappy
People think I'm joking; sorry, I'm not laughing


Darkness, all-consuming
No one understands
Storm clouds, always storming
Rain that never ends


Still caught up on all the shit that I'm lacking
Long days, this long face I carry through every interaction
It happens, that's what my therapist said
What's the point in me sharing if it's the negative shit
That be gaining traction?
That's on me
And everybody knows misery love company
But ain't a soul I know got lows like me
I'm just waiting for life to pull the rug out from under me
I find a relief in a shotter pack and a Heinekin
Wrong about everything that I write about
If I write it then time to know
That my actions could change a bit in my life
But I struggle to put my thoughts into action until I'm high again
On Vicodin, a Percocet could help me, feel like floating now
I get high when I'm low; it's a rollercoaster now
Seem all to help me is a bottle full of drink
And rock bottom is each day that I'm sober
That's how I know I'm down

I done seen niggas' hungry, robbing niggas' without bullets in the gun
I done seen niggas' talk money, catch a case
Can't pay their bond
I done see niggas' flexing wit their fake rollies
Running out of time
I done see niggas' try to come at bitches
Cuz they thought the bitch was mine
I done had bitches tell me that they love me
Should of known them hoes was lying
Bitches don't give a fuck if you're on the bed
Laying there dying
If you trapping, moving hard, they don't give a fuck
You sell it and you try it
All they want is different bags from Chanel
The gonna leave if you don't buy it
Only with you when you got it, only love you when you popping

Hollow tips, they come in handy
Niggas' wild'n on them zannies
Niggas' robbing their own family
Niggas' ball and never make the league
Every single day, I pray Felipe
Smile every time I see his daughter
Can't believe she really getting older
Nothing in the fridge but Baking Soda
I said ""fuck it"", had to take it over
I said ""fuck it"", had to fuck them over
I was trapping off a Motorola
Used to have dimes in my tube socks
I had my stash in a shoe box
Now I'm out L.A. with Young Chris
We in this motherfucking Blue drop
You know we high as a rooftop
We probably about to fuck 2 THOTS
I'm high as shit, smoking moon rocks
I'm eating grapes while I'm poolside
Bitches fucking for a Vegas trip
All these rappers niggas' making ""diss""
All these rapping niggas' make me sick
Shit they rap about, ain't making sense
Pussy, I ain't never played the bench
They gonna take if you front the shit
You can have her, I don't want the bitch
Fuck them, flea them, yeah we run through shit
We was really in the Jungle with it
Middle room, about a hundred niggas'
(?) broke my nigga, sweating bullets
Pussy, I'll have you ducking bullets
Living my life to the fucking fullest
Come to the beef, it ain't nothing to it
Got a pistol, better fucking use it

Grown, gone on bomb seedless hemp
Hound for potential prostitutes who need a pimp

Chokin' on roper in the back of Denali's
Drinkin' that snake bite, Yukon Jack

And jam with the rappers to the funky sound
Well I heard of this guy they call Master Gee
And I said he's ready to rock with me
Let me tell you something before you get lost
Angie B.'s the one that they call the boss
Hey all of your people this is no disguise
We're ready to rap and socialize
With the capital A-N-G-I-E
But it's really no fun without the capital B
Far as I'm concerned 'bout Master Gee
He's vicious when he's rappin' with me
(We're from the north!) And we're from the south!
And as a combination we can rock the house
We go

And we're on the stereo in your home

But you're listening to the voice of Cheryl The Pearl
We're gonna rap to you about the serious gang
With the bow-bow boogie and the big bang-bang
But since Big Hank didn't hear my voice
I guess I have no other choice
I heard he's bad, mean and tough
But I want to hear some of his funky stuff
Jam!

With a voice that stings like a bumblebee
Like Popeye needs spinach, kids need Tang
I need a little groove from the Sugarhill Gang
So open your ears, liberate your feet
We're gonna hit you with a little soulful treat
Like pecan pie without the crust
Like makin' love without the trust
Like watchin' TV without the screen
Like strawberry shortcake without the cream
Like April showers without the rain
Like hearing my voice and not knowin' my name
It's the Master Gee, the rappin' man
But the thing I like best is a ladies' hands
So fine and mine, I can't believe
Oh but day's touches will soon be leed

Behold ya eyes, I's wanna hold ya
Just hold ya tight like a four-leaf clover
I be goin' through your flowers, baby, your garden's open
A sight for sore eyes, good Lord I'm focused
Can hardly notice anything other
Than the woman with the face of my future baby mother
Tell 'em


I'm a big man, she's a big girl
Put on them heels and put on that skirt
She wants to get naughty, we can get bad
She's a good girl with the good girl dance
I'm ice cream, she's a hot swirl
We can get married and live in our world
Let's play rough, we can get wild
I can go home but I'll stay, cheat but I want you


So I go by Weezy, love me or leave me
I hate to leave her, I think I need her
She's such a teaser, such a diva
We can park right here, baby, fuck the meter
Throw it to me, baby, I can be ya receiver
Call me in the last minute, I can be ya reliever
Call me at the last minute, I be there even
Late night, early morning or maybe this evening

Three times for the ladies who ain't got no panties on

So get fly if you like to
Get high if you like to cause I know you like to
Put your hands up as high as you like to
And if it feels good scream ""hey-hey-hey yo""


I don't know about y'all
But we doin' it over here
All the glasses got liquid that blue in it over here
Cigars got somethin' sticky that's glueing it over here
Ladies movin' it over there, movin' it over here
I can fit a few in a Rover's rear
We havin' a good time, don't ruin it overs this
You see why we asks is to see ID
Cause girls will do anything for some VIP access
Me I relax this (easy)
Cause I'm used to ballin'
You could tell that these guys need practice
But if it was a problem then I would confront you
You saying ""no"" but ya eyes say you want to
But a pitcher that probably slugs, pitches and talk a put
I ride wit the top down and switch to the top-up look
Would you believe most these bitches go bop up shook
Their asses pokin' out like them pictures in pop up books



Oh yea! We's off the Richter Scale
Hate will get you, put in coffins quick as hell
If the ladies would show it off and thick as hell
For my hustlers knockin' off them bricks as well
And everybody, up north that's sick in jail
I probably feel y'all, send you all of the flicks in mail
The Street Family speed off in six SL's
To all them chicks that yell ""hey-hey-hey-hey yo""
Shake your glasses back and forth to mix it well
Shake your ass back and forth as quick as hell
And just from lookin' at them thighs from the front view
Girl I know that these guys say they want you
If I wake up in the sand, clothes from yesterday
Same hoes from yesterday
Lightin' clips to the same dro' from yesterday
Her hang-overs yesterday
You ain't mistaken we in Benz's today
But we had them Range Rovers yesterday



 (to fade)
Hey-hey-hey yo...
Hey-hey-hey yo..."

You say my prices high, that’s fine, you know you can bounce
If you my mans and I know you solid, I might throw you an ounce
But you ain’t gonna get it off or get no dough on the couch
You gotta network on the phone get dressed and get out the house
If you get pressed by them people, tell 'em ""figure it out""
Keep what you know in your brain, don’t let that shit out your mouth
‘Cause this a serious game we playin’, so you better wear your cletes
The rollers more street smart than the niggas in the streets
That’s why my game stays sharpy like a permanent marker
Creepin’ like a spider man, but I’m not Peter Parker
My bubble came from struggle, you niggas don’t know the half
Greenhouse got me ballin’ in Dallas just like the Mavs
When haters say “I'm trippin’” my nigga I just laugh

Thirty for the brick, seventeen for the half thang
All I talk is money nigga, all I spit is cash game

Niggas used to love H.E.R. but now she just a ho on the track
She's strippin up though out of stack, I wanna blow out her back
Shame we lowered the rap bars, replaced with this whack
I'm sharp like the slasher that stab ya, hittin ya face with the dagger

Your nigga has a nerve, you never been with a boss before

When I tell her I need some money, she don't complain, she just go with the flow

Hopsin,All Your Fault,rap,"I'm so tired
Of all the problems you've been causin' me
We are not cool no mo' as far as I can see
You kicked me down, I've fallen
I'm crawlin', it's all your fault


Mo' money, mo' problems it is
Now I'm back to writin' my lyrical novel again
I'm holdin' on grenades and I'm tryin' to not pull a pin
I done contemplated on downin' a bottle of gin
'Cause maybe that'll calm my nerves and get my ass on track
I'm on the fuckin' edge, I snapped and I just can't go back
I have no class, I'm cut from how my last ho act
She tried to ruin me, she damn near made my cash flow crash
I fuckin' hate this bitch, her name could sit on a grave
Only reason she ain't dead is 'cause my kid on the way
The bitch is pregnant and she strippin', dodgin' minimum wage
She done kicked me down, locked me up and spit on my face
I bought a ring for this bitch just to set it in stone
My headache has grown, damn I shoulda left it alone
Now heaven is gone, so is my love and it won't return
Welcome to hell, bitch, I hope you burn, because—


I'm so tired
Of all the problems you've been causin' me
We are not cool no mo' as far as I can see
You kicked me down, I've fallen
I'm crawlin', it's all your fault

Listen, lil' nigga, we ain't in the same shoes
You ain't built a name or even paid dues
Damn it, I'm ashamed of what it came to
And if you had've ever reached my level of fame guaranteed Dame would have played you
He's in the wrong, don't give me hate for it
You know him better than me
Y'all always had a broken relationship
Now you lookin' at me like I'm Satan's spawn
But five years ago you had made the same diss song
Why don't you put it out?
Show the world you hate your brother too
Don't be afraid to show the truth
Shit, you ain't got much to lose
Anyone can hold a gun up, but who's brave enough to shoot?
You know damn well he's addicted to rakin' up the loot
If you seen the shit I seen, you woulda taken sides with me
But you fuckin' disappeared and you ain't even ride with me
And now you wanna return when the label hit the bottom
Nigga, fuck you and your phoney mental problems!


I'm so tired
Of all the problems you've been causin' me
We are not cool no mo' as far as I can see
You kicked me down, I've fallen
I'm crawlin', it's all your fault

Too many motherfuckers judge my life
And make me out to be a monster like I love my strife
Too many motherfuckers pick at what the fuck I write
They hate to see me shine, they wish they could cut my light
I use my music as my public diary, it's what inspires me
It's why your fuckin' son admires me, come and fire me
Settle with the hell that I was put in, nuh-uh
You motherfuckers keep forgettin' I'm too good at my job
Y'all shoulda knew this, some think I'm too retarded and stupid
Overnight I just went and started a movement
The power at my fingertips is greater than Funk Volume and Ruthless
Ha ha, you still losin', you niggas thought you could do it
Go crawl in some sewage, you niggas ain't no entrepreneurs
You fucked with Hopsin Da Ruler and now I'm hollerin' screw ya
Hallelujah, all the deadweight is finally cut off
Niggas, the throne is mine, so stay the fuck off!


I'm so tired
Of all the problems you've been causin' me
We are not cool no mo' as far as I can see
You kicked me down, I've fallen
I'm crawlin', it's all your fault"
Douglass,Wu,rap,"Before I do the crime, let me see if it's worth doing the time
Okay, no disrespect to King Of The Dot, I know the chain real
But it been around a fake rapper neck all year it might've became steel
Yeah, I smack taste out you
I barely know you but I can tell you what I hate about you
You got cow titties, moving around in this wild city
I'm with a Mafia that never been around Biggie
I would tell you to Throw Ya Gunz in the air but that sounds Sticky
You finger killers
Rat, get a  up you don't know the cheat code
You would have me in a lineup like a free throw and I ain't even in the game with you
I don't feel that pain with you
I ain't never mask up and do a stain with you
But I will mask up, give an order and take out your food like a PF Chang menu
You eating where?
On my block you'll hear Nas but you'll probably see Dave East appear
You a fruit, at least a pear
To get to my level, your pen gonna have to go through training, for at least a year
Be prepared, for snake niggas, fake niggas
Bitches falling for you for months like Easter near
Keep a gun on you, maybe more than one on you
Or die when they try to kill a real boss like Keisha did
This ain't nothing New Jack
So if I'm shooting from my car you ain't gon' get to see every clip
I ain't Cyssero
You see these five fingers of death? Kiss 'em tho
Cause a shot go off in a Harlem night, we don't miss a toe
You dead boy
You gon' try to tell me where I'm from and I already think you a fag boy
Quiet that, 'fore I fire back
And the last sound coming through your speaker
Is you snorting off your blood through the wiretap
What's really pimping?
I smack the bitch out you and put her on a ho stroll
You take care of these spenders, get back at me or BAOW get back at me
I don't fear these spitters
I'm God, Jesus in the flesh, ain't no controlling that
They looking at this Mr. Strange but that's why I got picked by the road for that
F1-50, before I XLT I was already on the road for that
Who riding with me?
I scare you so bad I make you rob you with me
Don't make us hurt you
The only way you disrespecting ours is if you breaking curfew
Speak up Rone
You got a little hate in your blood I should speak up on
Now y'all know Brenda had a baby but she had to trash it
Cause his father couldn't keep her home
Speak up Rone
I can't let this wait til next time
We got a Colombian Necktie, you did a month in Bedstuy
Figured you thuggish cause you snuck a stolen Christmas tree past the alarm in Best Buy
I show you a star you can reach in the Left Eye
Speak up Rone
Your phony smile is why I don't trust your love
You get MC Gusto love
As far as drugs, you like 'em new or lean, you should've knew not to trust those sluts
Fuck ya stories
If you old dog, shit going down faster than Cane 40
Ain't no 'burban love for a nigga who ain't got the same for me
With my own two eyes I watched you abuse drugs
Walk into a hotel room with another man like you was boo'd up
A few hours later I heard moans and groans but I coulda got it screwed up
The next day, I had to battle you and now you up here acting like you tough
So talk that shit don't joke with me
Cause where I'm from ain't no hope for me
That's why my higher power got me right where I'm supposed to be

I'll lay hands on Head like I'm trying to heal something
Fucking Head ICE, how you bald headed with head lice?
You're too yellow to get green so your career is at a red light
Get your head right, or get it busted with a Mag light
I got instruments to get him kilt and I ain't talking bagpipes
A cut above, I'll prove it when I slash Jeffe
He gon' need a pair of graphs (paragraphs) when I half esse (essay)
This fogie hasn't pulled a tan in the last decade
I'll throw a cross on Head like it's Ash Wednesday
I come up acting religious on you dumb asses
Hold it like a crucifix, when I come at him

He gon' get jerked if he play the Caribbean
This fake pussy got a buzz, the fuck is he a Sybian?

We're really tripping, we're really ripping on samurais
Get him zipped up, Cliff Hux' with the Spanish Fly
I'll beat a chicken like Peter Griffin from Family Guy
Bro, they must've forgot that I could bar your life away
Fuck ICE's age, you look like they threw Michael Che in a microwave
I mean look at what I get paid
I couldn't skate on what ICE get paid
Plus I'm going for the three peat like when Michael played in the '98 title games
So bitch you gon' need a miracle like that Kevin Dyson Titan play
Who you kidding? Back in prison you got pressed like a license plate
So bitch name the time and place I'll show up drinking Elijah Craig
And throw your step mother in a death cutter like I was Diamond Page
You still trying to get booked in New York? But you're striking out like you're Ryan Howard
URL offered him a contract for $8.95 an hour
The way that Smack and Beasley fucked you over and made you look like a coward
You probably had flashbacks to getting Eiffel Towered in the back of a Riker shower
How could you be head of the class when you barely have your faculties?
I've been grilling nationwide with the chain just like I'm Applebees
I got your chick blowing up my phone, it's not a Samsung Galaxy
I'll fuck ICE crush, they crush ICE like I'm making a daiquiri
Bro I'll have her in pad tied and I'm not talking Thai food
I'll give her three lines like a haiku then carve in him that's an ice luge
My thinking ain't like you, my brainstorm is a typhoon
My thought process is too cold, my IQ is ICE cubed
I told you, I done all your wolves like Kris Dunn on the Wolves
They're rookies, roll the cookie give me something to pull
I eat the wolf and the sheep, leave nothing but wool
Rone, I'm like Pamplona I've been running these bulls
That's one

Stop it dyke
You got your Thug Passion from listening to that 'Pac at night
Any rocket blasting off from you is the pocket type
I bet my forearm, you don't know the two crews' name in the Sonny Carson fight
You a fraud and I know it
Had a deal though
But all they needed to do was sign his name on the side of a dildo and he blowing
Don't let him fool you for nothing
If dreads would've approached me for K, he'd a slide on ICE and look Cool Running
You a lame black
Repping Philadelphia but was in Toronto talking 'bout how Freeway got his chain snatched
I hope they catch you in an alley for disrespecting State Property and Beans beat you with the same bat
I don't like Rone the way I think he do
I feel the same way about pink eye too
I ain't Dice Raw so you can leave cause I don't need these type of seeds or branches near my Roots
And that's the first story
I walked through numerous doors and watched you give me the phony smile
I almost blacked but I toned it down
But I wanted to give you everything like the only child
I put blood in your mouth and dirt on your back
Hold your head underwater til you see the release date of where Surf can come back
Gun Titles, don't make me get Roc involved
Quest and Marv is like Wayne and Max when the shots are called
Link up
Who wanted me to win tonight? Put your drinks up
And be ready to pour it on the head of a Rone supporter if they speak up
Pack mentality
I been a king before they asked Pat to battle me
Your Totino commercial was wack in all actuality
I'm just keeping it a G like the check they gon' give me after you battle me
I need Natural Born Killers; Mickey and Mallory
I told you 'bout picking bitches to battle me
So from this point on I'm switching my salary
You appreciate your right and your wrong doings
But the real can't get along to it so from this point on
The chain will no longer be attached to a corn moving
Nigga Philly don't even respect yo' gangsta
You wasn't busting (bussing) nothing til the metro came up
Go to an event out there I bet yo' chain tuck
Cause you softer than a shirt on Jay-Z next door neighbor
Is this Philly finest? I'm asking y'all, ""Is this Philly finest?""
Well I get the grip from Frank and pay Reed Dollaz to really find him
Stash the Tec(h) then, give him a Dose of that Kaboom in a Philly diner
My Mac wilding, I been with Chris and Snoop but
Only Marlo know where to really find us
Gangsta! You know nothing about
Crews, meeting up with crews on neutral ground
But leaving with more than just a punch in they mouth
You ain't never had to drag a body that been shot after an after party
Return fire and make it to the car and feel like a lonely person finally have somebody
I ain't trying to get too deep but this ain't virgin pussy he had somebody
Look at him, standing there like he ain't feeling it
Sensitive, Missy pull a Mag' I say ""oow"", Timbaland let's make a beat
If I only had you and Pat Stay as a customer I make more than Sean Combs made in a week
Take that, take that
Yeah, what? What?
I get accused of it cause y'all don't really know who using it
But these coke boys got more hits than Eminem first three years in the music biz
What? I ain't exposing nothing, it's time you own to something
Standing there like the Jonas Brothers
And we been Trading Places and this the sequel to my movie When a black man is giving money back to the homeless brothers
""Randolph, we're back""
You seen the movie nigga, yeah you don't belong with greatness
I've been in the hall with fame way before y'all I'm Walter Payton
Step your yards up, after you put your guards up
They don't respect the devil til God's up
So those saints and sinners cause you pair are normal (paranormal) is The Marked Ones
Thank you Jesus
Hallelujah, I take a hit of that holy water then sell Molly to you, I'm hood
So don't ask me if we move the work out
If you don't handle business
The package move you see an arm come out with the thumb up; Planet Fitness
I'm too clever, ICE, losing to you? Never
Before that happen I will walk past you then give you seven snaps to the back of your head, this a New Era
So talk that shit, don't joke with me
Cause where I'm from ain't no hope for me
That's why my higher power got me right where I'm supposed to be
King me nigga
ICE!

So this round is entitled, 'You Sweaty Faced Old Fuck'
You sweaty faced old fuck, you look like the crying Jordan meme
Perspiration flooding like a torrent stream through his pores and cheeks
Face wetter than Golden State when it's pouring threes
Face wetter than a washed up quarter ki on the coral reef when it storms in the Florida Keys
Face wetter than this seafloor of the foreign fleets that stormed the beach of Normandy
Bro, what's the problem?
Please do not lie to me
You overheated? You got anxiety?
Cause that's not what the team meant when they mentioned ""getting the beak wet""
In a matter of three sec's you could sweat through a V-neck
You might be passing the G test but you're not passing the leak test
Cause I'll make a 10 G bet that you're related to Keith Sweat
Yo, you're so sweaty, it looks like your body was covered in Soul Glo
You're so gassed you spit a round and put a hole in the Ozone
You Frisbee'd Real Deal's album, thinking you're so cold
Bitch, I'll download your album and then Frisbee my own phone

{throws his phone into the crowd}

Yo my shit is insane, watch this bitch get erased
I throw shit around and hit a bitch in the face
But you have a terrible habit of always rhyming the same word
You did that shit back in the day, now you still rhyming the same?...Word
You think you're better than me? Who you wanna battle Head?
Budden?
Your girl come around, she go down, I might as well hit the Head button
That .45, how his head butt in, I'll zip him, get head butting
He's nothing, if Head butt in I'm getting him headbutted
Yo, you think you got the juice old man? But you barely have your fucking, yo...
You got the juice old man? You can't fuck with it, it doesn't even matter
I'ma put his ass through detox, I'll throw the cube's on ICE, best believe I got a mean cross
I'll put the boots to the wolf, that means fur all in my Reeboks and then I'll piss on ICE just to let some fucking steam off
But, you told KG you'd make him fuck Rum Nitty, what a thing to casually say
I know battle rapping is pretty homophobic as it is, but I'm pretty sure that's actually gay
But to your fans who are obsessed with you it's somehow not a factor
They could walk in on you fucking a dude and they'd be like, ""That's not gay, that's gangster.""
Fucking wolf gang/Wolfgang pushing keys/ki's like he think that he Mozart
You love drive-by's so much you'd try one on the Pope's car
Your license get suspended you're doing drive-by's on a go-kart
Your gun gets stolen, you're doing drive-by's with a blow dart
You're having marriage problems, you do a drive-by to get it straight
Your daughter gets an A, y'all do a drive-by to celebrate
So now most of your friends are dead and that pain hurts
But most of my friends are married and that's way worse
Bro, he'll act like he's got dirt on me but it's coming with the asterisk
Cause we're boys, that's the point, these people don't know the half of it
He'll be like, ""I crept on him on Jefferson, with the entrance out the back of it.""
I'll be like, ""Ah, yeah, I gave you my address when you asked for it.""
But I heard about Drake's birthday party, you got the big invite
The biggest moment of your life annnnd you missed the flight
Flying to Drake's 30th could've taken your career to different heights
But I guarantee there will be a 30 in this bitch tonight
You probably show up geeked off your battle with Pat Stay
Thinking the invite meant that your career might have legs
Thinking you had some G status, cause he knew that you bag weight
But if you were at Drake's birthday party with the ki's/keys, you're working the valet
Bro, he's got you shining boots, you're trying to steal wristwatches
You whip the blade out they say, ""Perfect we need limes for the gin tonic.""
You grab the invite list like, ""Let me think on it. He probably wants a pimp on it.""
Nah, if you're at Drake's birthday party with the trey/tray, there's probably shrimp on it

That's two baby


Look at bony, tenderoni, try to get all buff on me
When you the type of guy to walk up to a man and say, ""A mouth is a mouth"" and try to undo his zipper on him
I represent for the real ones that got cell phones in jail
I could just mack a Roney (macaroni) for the cheese cause if we ain't rubbing elbows it's shells
This a wolf vs a zebra, we don't know if you black or white
An Italian that want Catholic stripes
Be with Muslims but you (Jew) too stingy, they gotta ask you twice
I like the part of you that's likable
In this round from time to time I'ma get hype with you
But I'm in no rush, I got all night with you
I made it to this point with an open heart
On my journey was a lot of blood, sweat and tears but I gave no remarks
I stood aside and let the hood decide
Lived off the fame but financially if it wasn't for what I put aside
I wouldn't have the coins to accumulate the bills I need to put you in that suit and tie
Hip hop break up families, shout to those who lost theirs to entertainment
The one who had a real woman by they side and when it was time to prepare for the show
They was just looked at as a ho or a bitch complaining
My heart goes out to the kids who father's can't make up for lost time
And for family members who love they friends more than they own kind
On that note:
Philly, Philly, Philly believe me we go harder
I've been had beef with Toronto, this is for Joe Carter
And y'all suck in battle rap, believe me dummy
Just as much as your country...sucks at being a country
Any nation in this world in fact could take y'all cookies
Cause do Toronto care?
No, ya'll just being cool with being pussy
What? What? Y'all don't like that?
Y'all can't joke with that shit?
Then why is there two chains around the neck of the man WHO WROTE THAT SHIT?
See where I'm from we do background checks
And if a person ain't real right, they get they whole background checked
That's why the face and fraud ain't been back 'round yet
Cause a clip hold 50 and we don't respect y'all rules but we ain't back down yet nigga
Run with me? And it's a gun on three
We won't let shit pass
But front on me? And I'ma stab you and make step-and make you carry the work in yo' shit bag
Yo girl keep mandingos in her mouth
You don't even be tripping
You just wonder why the blacks fuck with her
Well, low prices attract customers
You and Real Deal was cool until me, Poison and Rex ran down on 'em with the camera
You opened the door so you a co-d to the murder, no propaganda
We exposed him for falling asleep in the Jack London
Caught you throwing back beers entertaining two black hookers
As you call 'em
Your smile turned to a frown, we decided to chill and roll up and sat with ya
I wasn't sure if you was mad cause we fucked up your chances of these two black sisters
Or cause you had to sit there and spark a fake conversation that only relate to you and these three black niggas
Battle rap, Roney never break dance
He don't got a graffiti name but he spray cans
He can't quote the Mobb tape
He don't know to get to the top it take E-Z Rob and Mobb Base
If he give you a mem- a trip down memory lane, don't be surprised if he pop in a prom tape
Cause this grandma favorite grandson
Well of course he is
He the only one who don't remember what kind of whore she is
Grandma favorite grandson, is a racist
I'm talking Rudy Giuliani with that
But he wanna put his brain in my body, I guess it's cool to be black
Grandma favorite grandson, grew up to be just as gentle as the smile y'all using on shirt for the sales pitch
But that old bag had too many seeds in it, you sell nicks
Grandma favorite grand- man for that chain I'ma Yung Berg you
You only laugh with one circle, step out that box I'ma tell Day' to suit up
I wanna see you disrespect those G's and apes that come purple
It ain't no question you gay
That ain't the message today
You not a boy from the hood cause you was in the living room coming up with punches
That wasn't the message from Tre
Where's the pussy?
Seeing you with a bitch is rare like using beer as dip for cookies
Get your taste right
And make sure you strap before I take off on you; safe flight
So talk that shit don't joke with me
Cause where I'm from ain't no hope for- you know what?
Meth' wore the chains but we still don't respect your ancestors
Cause you a different kind of Klan member
Y'all don't get it, if he win the chain that's three K's
He a different kind of Klan member
So talk that shit don't joke with me
Cause where I'm from, ain't no hope for me
That's why my higher power got me right where I'm supposed to be
King me nigga
ICE


So poor people talk about how rich they are to show the world they're hustling
Meanwhile rich people talk about how poor they are and uh, boy am I struggling
But this shit cannot be true, but word's been going around
I heard that ICE lives in central Pennsylvania now?
That shit broke my heart, in fact it had me fucking bodied
Who gets rich and says, ""Fuck it. Kids we're moving to Punxsutawney.""
I mean, I thought you were destine for stardom
I thought you would break down barriers
I thought the H in your name stood for Harlem
Now what's it stand for? Harrisburg?
I mean it's pretty clear that you were having problems paying your rent
And housing is cheaper where you live now by 80%
But you flashing fake chains and cash homie, what you gotta lie for?
See it's not your fault if you're born poor, but it is your fault if you die poor
See my pops is from Harlem, all of this facts
From Frederick Douglass, your same exact project at that
Then he went from public housing to a physicist who's all in the lab
So either my pop's is a gangster...or you're as soft as my dad
I know what every battle rapper makes, I've held the contracts and I've read the shit
For him to act like he's eating off rap makes me incredulous
You did five battles last year, what a stress on the penmanship
And got paid $2000 a battle and that's being generous
Say $500 a month off merch' if you push it all the time
Say 10 features for $200 if you're really on your grind
If you add that shit together to feed a family of five
You're still 10 grand below the poverty line
So you either swallowed your pride and you got a shitty job
Or you're still selling drugs to lost teens and single moms
Sell hand to hand in crack rock to pregnant ladies like it's the 80's
Damn, I'd at least thought Head would have a soft spot for the babies
Bro, if you're not rich from selling drugs by now then you're terrible at it
Name a more loyal customer than a heroin addict
I mean, y'all thought I'd talk about his age?
But that story's been told and told
People were calling you old ten years ago
ICE, even calling you old is old
But you're not old, you're still out here trying to make that big step
I mean you can't afford to act old cause you still haven't done shit yet
Fucking, New York rappers came and past you and now they're filling stadiums
You an underground O.G.?
That just means there's like six era's you haven't made it in
Yo, when Paid In Full came out, you could barely get funds
It didn't even matter you looked like Rakim's stepson
When Junior M.A.F.I.A. made Get Money, you couldn't get none
When Kurtis Blow made The Breaks, you still couldn't catch one
When A$AP made Peso you couldn't afford a dub
When 50 Cent came out, you couldn't get In Da Club
You'v been passed by every class from Desiigner to Wu
So when Jada' said We Gon Make It he wasn't talking about you
I don't give a fuck if the facts are offending him
Cause any false premises is a set up for a let down
But Bobby Shmurda could serve like four life sentences
And you still wouldn't be popping by the time that he gets out
I mean, what you know about being fulfilled by your day job, playboy?
See, he's trying to play with me knowing that he's not the same as me
When you're done battle rapping, that's the last we'll hear from you
That's not the case for me
You are tethered to a world that doesn't mean shit to me
I'm well paid and self made and I approach the game differently
When I was flying myself to Thailand, the Greek Islands and Sicily
You were in self imposed poverty trying to decide what kid to feed
If you're still selling drugs now, then you're as dumb as those free basers
Them thinking you're a gangster, won't mean shit if you need paper
You have the body of an old man and the mind of a teenager
So even if you win the chain it'll be at a Scranton pawn shop a week later bitch!"
Montana of 300,Godly,rap,"{Intro}
God over everything
To God almighty

{Verse 1}
I give praise
The truth it hurts
So lies is made
And men in search of power use religion to design a slave
See we are trying to find a way
While trapped inside this giant maze
Where niggas let that iron blaze
And lost in simple minded ways
Where we hear mothers cry and rage
And its to hard to hide the pain
Dont try to count up how much money ive made
Go count the lives ive saved
Theres so much light behind the shade
And everynight i climb the stage
Moving people on these tracks
With lines like they was riding trains
I aim to be the wisest sage
Who thinks like those twice his age
Been balling long as Isaac Hayes
That fire man whose eyes ablazed
Twelve passing judgement some days i would get harassed for nothing
Did massive stunting back in the day when the trap was jumping
Sold packs of bud and didn't have a budget still strapped in public
Somehow im winning and haters can't break the pattern of it
They mad at something their cash is coming and ask for nothing
I kept faith in God so I had it coming you got to love it
Between the Lord and my lyrics
I produce life like two lovers
I chase my dream with my team and watched it unfold like new covers
Dont try to act like you love us but on the inside you jealous
In times of comfort and fear they always show their true colors
I swear they hate on my success
But they give ear to my word
They fear what they heard, the Rap God is clear, I'm superb
Yeah Satans nervous
The demons sweating
I've picked the setting
I keep progressing and teaching lessons till hes beheaded
This lethal weapon
Unleashed aggression to keep from stressing with the deepest message
Might reach the heavens thats key possession
Dont fall into that Devils trap
Just look how far it set us back
Just know that you can broaden your horizon without steppin back
God never gave his word
You might be following that Devils map
To set someone up for a lie
They always start by telling facts
Lots of edits from different authors
Added lies to the saga
What understanding loving father dips his kids into lava
All religions are just a business with scriptures written by scholars
Where preachers try to sell hope and take your almighty dollar
We sat with them chains
And got hung like a swing set
And if you still sitting waiting then you haven't grown wings yet
Wings up thats elevation freedom thats what my team reps
Keeping digging cause theres history that you haven't seen yet
I used to eat with some gangsters
On that ave with them forks
And niggas knew where to find me either the trap or the court
Please keep your sons out them streets
Go put they ass into sports
And all my lyrics cut deep
Like i was rapping with swords
Im always bringing that heat
Like i was passing a torch
And giving credit to God
Like he was passing a course
So just let go of the worse
And just hold onto the best
While on that road to success you got to know that you're blessed
Possessed the power to heal
I taught myself how to use it
Yeah we all aim for the top but do you know how to shoot it?
See me i go through the music with hopes that you dont confuse it
Although this life is abusive understand life is exclusive
Dead men wish they was in our shoes
But had the chance and they blew it
Theres no more sex
Theres no more ticks
No bomb expert can defuse it
Theres no more Ls when life expires we hope God can renew it
While your loved ones left with that pain but you won't be there to soothe it
Im from the land of the laws where theres no way to recoup it
You pray to God and say you love him then be godly and prove itSee Montana of 300 LiveGet tickets as low as $69You might also like"

Got my man the soul father Rasco
Man, Oh No, Disrupt
Taking you on another journey from the left coast
Remix
You know how we do


For the mind, for the love
For MCs who don't have to smoke weed
You're number one
Bounce to this cut, we bound to erupt
Wild child, Rasco, an my man Disrupt


Treat MCs like weed, grab the bong
Step up and straight smoke em
While my fella may be tellin em my adrenaline is mad potent
Nobody can test the nutty professor
When i  rock an music get ugly
Open his mouth when he's not using his bong
An then fill it with putty
Cause your definition of weed is not my definition of weed
This nation will progress to a higher state of manifest of weed
All come together to see all people are created equal
Just to see through, your blood and mistake
Might come out that leak through
Your conscious state of being
Are you afraid of being so
While me and the Cali cats enhance the art of MC-ing
Try an think, when your definition of weed defines the right weed
Weak MC's enhance by the dank, weed
Earth didn’t mix well when you thought
You're left farther shooting the Glock
Were you smoking before you started to rap, difficult to concoct
No disrespecting intended, when Wild child comes to construct
Got my man soul  the father, Rasco an the Disrupt

Aye, what's up? Aye, I heard you got a little writer's block. You know what I'm saying? I got something for that, 'cause I can get you high


Smoke it up after this creep disruptor
Inhale lyrics of weed, laced with alternating places
That will leave your mouth to bleed, it’s pitiful
A smoke always critical
Lyrically enhance your mental naturally
Kill you like a cereal, to mash with me, y'all niggas must be criminals
Swervin, windows fallin and burnin
Niggas neva learn, servin
One mil enough, one bil you’re stuck
Come on see that can’t live without Disrupt, rupture
But don’t get me wrong, what’s up dog
I smoke too to chill out at a show with my crew
Lyrics get done, number one 	up on
The most green couldn’t run
Up outta county wow my style
The sex is schizophrenia
Never knew what old
Look around hit the ground like the media
Deep impact, where you can’t fade
Get you open like the Ross switch blade
Seek your medical aid
Hate all my ways
Ya’ll rapper get played

For the mind, for the love
For MCs who don't have to smoke weed
You're number one
Bounce to this cut, we bound to erupt
Wild child, Rasco, an my man Disrupt


If beat were weed, if mics were weed
If hip-hop were weed, if MCs were weed
Would you get high 


If MCS were weed then i would smoke all day
I’d have me a drink, sit back an try to parle
There was never a need for me to feed my brain with chemicals
Just so i can spit out subliminals
I’d be the type to leave the hype to the fans
While me an my man Jack re-lace the track
We back in the lab with mad lib for the fix
I don’t smoke weed but i would sell ya’ll six
See my thoughts come from inside of the soul
You breaking your back looking for major league rolls
See I just like to play the background
Ready for the crackdown, repping the bay
Leads to sacktown, out to LA
My dough floats over notes like these
If it works keep smoking the trees, please
Don’t get it wrong  if you wanna get smoked it’s cool
But don’t make that the number one rule, rule, rule

When you represent hip-hop on a negative you get killed in it
Take my life i’d rather jump and hop from the top of a building
And bounce back with a quickness  while you front like ya’ll get pardon
Who’s thinking you ain’t got nutten to lose, your name ain’t Martin
I’ll approach it like a video game I’m Jack the strange writer
Five more minutes for the Cali cats who decided to change fighter
The name Miter, means you put yourself with hang lighter
Knock it down on the floor mat, before mat be arrange tighter
Game over, seems at times when you read between the lines
Get inside the rap, battle of invasion provide the track
I take the weed issue seriously, no joke
So don’t take it personal, so Wild child don’t provoke
When I rap I make you uplift nod your head, side step
If you got metal frustration and need some herbal liftation, check it
Here’s something for your mind when you gonna start running around
Act like you got a penis in your chest
Come straight from the heart


For MCs who don't have to smoke weed
Get on the

Said I can’t take no more stress
I always ask, well when the music stops
What's really left
I got accomplishments, and goals
But I still ask who I am
They say success turn you cold
But I'm heating up for my fam
See I got destiny waiting
I finally see the light
I see the planets aligning
I feel like we on tonight

I still got places to see
I still got things I'm perusing
While I'm on root to my dream
I got things I forget
And people I leave behind
I hate to say you fall victim
But out of site out of mind
I'm on a new road, with new friends
I’m past doubt

Nicky Trakks,Burn (Yamamoto Rap),rap,"Yeah, more flame like lava poured into your veins
The heart's bursting with wounds, fill it with propane
Nah, I'm the mass causing explosion and more pain
Brainstorm for the head storm, what a God's slain
I'm in my lane, more twist out the knees
Every direction under my claim, man, I been a beast
We don't need a bigger fist to calm, so one big as me
Fifty million degrees, selfish when I hit the grease
I don't leave a drains, what you waiting me, it's half list
Pass test, I can raise an army from the assets
Pressure bring a boost, I'm giving energy the masses
Blade disintegrated anything that I clash with
Oh, you a halfling, split 'em in the half shit
Said that he want smoke, oh, that's perfect, he can have it
Every time that Bankai release causing havoc
Zankai no Taichi, wait 'till I blast it!


You really think you're doing work? But it's ashes that you earn
I keep that heater full force, so that usher let it burn
If it's passion that you want, I'm melt Gibson with my warm
If you asking what it costs, you're not the fraction of my worth
I'm a master with the sword, I told you bastards, I'm a hazard
You gon' have the fucking line, I'm the Captain, that's for sure
I catch 'em capping, that's the last thing that you asked was gonna hear
It gets graphic, then they panic, I mean exactly what they fear
I'm like fire mixed with lava, drench the gas, engulf the flames
And catch you slipping just to fake them, and your body's set ablaze
Incinerations what you facing, you can't face it, that's OK
Just embrace it, I'm the greatest, you don't have to check the name
Applying pressure, you can't measure all this fire that I keep inside my soul
Know they tried it, but they tired, and they think I'm getting old
Cut the wire, I'm so fire like the view, so watch it blow

And it's to all those locos that like to gangbang
Because I do it when I have to when it's every fuckin weekend
Always kickin it with my homies
But could swear they're always tweaking
But the only drug I use is marijuana
People tell me not to smoke it
But I'll smoke it if I wanna
Cause right now living in the fast lane
So tell me what's wrong with smoking a little bit of Mary Jane
And when I fight
I fight mano a mano
Porque, simon I'm a down ass Chicano
I'll say it again I'm down for mine esé
Or laugh at you if you need a shank over a cuete
And then I'll call you a chavala
As I rock over the jam in my '62 Impala
And if you shoot you better kill
Cause if you don't and you won't
But then I will
You won't rest in peace you'll rest in pain
Why, because my mind clicks
To be insane in the brain
Simon I'm fuckin bad to the bone

You should've seen how fast we jumped off of our ass
We ran outside just to check out what it was
It's a Mexicano thing
I ain't no Crip or Blood
Dark in the Garden so I couldn't see
Though I looked to the light and I saw my Primo
Laying there moaning; That's all I hear
But right now Lil' Rob ain't got time to shed a tear
We picked him up, we took him home and called the ambulance
Those vatos fucked up good
Cause now they're gambling with their lives
And it's about time they lose
Never fuck with the vato in the Sureño blues
To the Mexican desmadre, let's pull a drive-by
'Cause when we lose one, that's when they seem to lose about five
But we're not satisfied holmes until they all die
So oralé let's jump in my lowride
Dame las llaves I threw 'em in the ignition
Oralé now we're on another fuckin mission
Turn on the radio on came the rolas
Homeboys in the back loading up the pistolas
Oralé they're loaded
It's time to do it
I just got my drivers license cause I'm 16 with a bullet
Not alone, my homeboy's in his Bomb
And to you puto's you won't last long
See I'm with my homies and all of them are packin

Now as we're driving away I hear a youngster say
""Yo, Lil' Rob let me blow that mothafucker away""
I said ""Chale, jump out the ride""
He opened up the door and then he jumped outside
He said ""Orale, then alrato""
I said ""Hey we'll be back little vato""
So off we go to the other varrio
Not cruising too fast we're always cruising slow
We saw somebody started running cause they took a glance
They didn't have time to shit their pants
Take a look over there, damn some fine heinas
Too bad they're playing dice throwing their signs at us
But it's alright
We're looking for the fool who shot my Primo
Cruisin slow and guess who we see so
We crept up in the Bomba and took a look
So Lil' Rob said ""Que onda""
I said fuck it jumped out the bucket he had a bat
So he swung and so I duck and I saw his face
So I stuck it with a right left, right left
I made him suffer homes
And then I put the nine milli to his backbone
I said ""Hey mothafucker don't breathe
Cause right now Lil' Rob really wants to see you bleed
I flipped him over put the gun between his eyes
I said ""You fucked up once and I hope
That's what you realize, now how the fuck does it feel
You played at your own risk and now you found out I'm for real""
Boom, boom back in the ranfla I'm reminiscing
With a tear in my eye cause it's my raza that I'm killing
Looking at him dead in the face I shot him twice
Now fuck that shit for sure will get 7-25 to life
But fuck that shit it's time to go home
No longer cruising slow I'm rushing to my canton
I'm thinking what my Primo wanted me to do
You think he'd want me to serve life for a punk or two
Or even cry over him for a couple of days
Damn Raza we've got to change those evil ways
Though, soy chingon cabron
Like Al' Capone always holding my own
Walking alone in the S.D. anger zone
Simon bad to the bone
Not the one to talk shit over the telephone
And San Diego is the place where all my homeboy's roam
And all I could say is don't fuck around homes
Cause I'm a...

She high like the sun, thick like cornbread and I'm ready to party
That hay got me so gotdamn horny but I don't like that tramp
The only reason I'm poppin that coochie cause the ho had a book of foodstamps
And I got the munchies, I need soul food, collard greens or pinto beans
If you smoke hay like the conflict do, then you know what the hell I mean

Smokin on
Hay in the middle of the barn
Smokin on
Hay in the middle of the barn


Rollin down the block
Car full of flies and the flies tried to rise up out dat door crack
Got my niggas in the barn smokin on that hay stack
Back up on the scene from smokin herb so creep up on the wall and all I heard
Was a bud of mine who dropped a needle in the hay with a funky dime word
Couldn't be myself, couldn't smoke wit nobody else
If I didn't pass it to the left, nigga would have lost my breath
Open up the window 'fore I fall and faint but I can't cause I roll around in dat barn ride
Rollin up the hootie hoo, roughest skin roller on dat west side
Nigga come on in, I got some hay, won't you close dat barn door
Nigga what you let them flies out for? Ain't nobody to rich, we poor
Lettin all the contact smoke up in the barn, the flies keep us chokin
Thank you Jesus Christ for all the hay you're givin us cause we'll keep on smokin'


Smokin on
Hay in the middle of the barn
Smokin on
Hay in the middle of the barn"

Mr. Criminal,Let Them Have It,rap,"I'mma hit them with the vers-a-tility
Spit a deadly soliloquy, a swarm of killer bees finna kill the beat
I'm every one of them, bzz, ""Summon 'em""
Coming up to put them in a coffin I'mma punish them
Cause I'm the crypt keeping, beat lyncher, meat stincher
Feel the heat against your body about to reach in ya
I'm teaching ya, all a lesson, follow the lesson or catch the hollow tip of my teeth when I eat dinner
When you've been rapping as long as the DNA has
Every second you spit, you ain't gotta spray fast
I could lay your ass down with a chill flow
And penetrate you with the steel spiked dildo
Lyricism for real though, you're still cracking gay jokes
All up in the closet chilling with them gay folks
I stay cold, and lace dope beats with delayed flows that I hold back from it like a rainbow
There you go, think I'm gay, cause I mentioned a rainbow
Which is a metaphor cause you don't know where my brain go
Somebody thinking they gonna be finding the way of my lyrical mastery
Fuck with the DNA making them flee away, head for the hills a catastrophe
Is coming your way, I'm propping you up, just like a trophy when I takin' the
Head of my opponent, and really when I get to fuckin' with the way I put 'em in a daze
Everytime I get up on it I'mma murder any motherfucker thinking they can test me
On the mic, it's DNA, I'm about to bring the hurt to ya
This is Undaground Choppers 3, a cypher by Sprite Beatz
With an elite group of choppers, you're about to get served
By the lyricist murking ya, on the search for the only way to beat me is to become a lyrical murderer
Now I'm bout to let the rest of these choppers speed it up for ya
Holler at me when you're fully recovered from ya surgery

Chopping ain't about people not understanding what you say
It's all about the timing and delivery that you display
When you have a record in your break it and just go away, take it to another level, treat it like there's no escape
Giving it all you got, ready to split it like a banana
Hit it with hammers, ready to bang on it like blue and red bandanas
You don't need no manager to handle what you doing
It's underground independency that can't nobody ruin
Represent a culture has turned you into a soldier
And you ready to battle until the war is over
If they come any closer to you, you goin let them have it, go after them like a savage, thats crazy and fucking rabid
Y'all goin understand that I'm a veteran with this
I do it to appease you when I'm spitting it this quick
They say that I'm different and a lyrical misfit
Busting like a Tommy when the trigger go click click
Putting them all in a coffin I'm ready to bury them I murder music, You won't have a chance to defend yourself when I fucking lose it! Faggot on the truest
One of the best up out of Kansas City ain't nobody fucking with me
Tech said that very clearly
Why you wanna try to go against the land shark
Everywhere I pop-up is a landmark
I ain't even playing, I got fans in Denmark
And Alaska, too, they roll up on you in the dark
This is the part where I make them a victim
Slow it down a little then I shove it up in them
I been doing it for years a nigga kicking that wisdom
Never was a snake but I've been spitting that venom
Mr. ape shit on the track with them choppers
Them deadly apostles, them verbal Pirahnas
Spitting like machetes and lyrical Jeffrey Dahmer's
Minus the gay shit you can get ate quick


When I'm giving you the venom I never surrender I'm ready for it if I pound my fist
Underground, never thought I'd put it down like this
Summon off a demon, the moment I sound like this
Call me the basket case, summon every demon I feed 'em little bags of waste
Put the mask to face, rabbit out the hat to wait
Now rub the dick up in the middle finna agitate
I tell 'em all ""Summon devils always love will fall""
Corrupting the minister, I'mma sick 'em all
I'mma feed 'em my medicine, kill the rhythm when I talk
You might suffer the ritual, intermission kill 'em all
I'd recommend you stop, it's the MK Ultra
Better recollect your thoughts or I'm coming to get a mission and suffer til we fall
Better recognize I'm a villain, I'm wicked when I chop
Psycho, I'm a  be leavin' 'em hollow finna trick
My trigger finger's itching to get to flickin, I'm hoping you reconsider while I do it for the sinners
Better get in my rhythm or homie you's a beginner
When ever I be up on you put you in amazement
You ain't trying to see me, I'll put you deep in the basement
Killing off every enemy sending 'em to the faces
Sick of me what you're thinking he's sticking deep in occasion
I'll be the body getting up in your guts
Fuck 'em reload, G'd up a millimeter I'mma see get beat up enough
For I'mma reach up in the scene, I be defeating and crush
Hella cynic but I've been in just eating 'em up
Spitting venom like a mouth of the scorpions
Walking through portals like I'm immortal and morphed again
I'm feeling forced to sin, I'm Kamikazi from the source of it
I'm from the underground orphanage, chopper

(Fix nigga...)
What you’re witnessing is the pinnacle
Of chopping at it’s finest
Representing Memphis
It’s Krucafix up in this bitch i’m about to kill it
I spit it like heavy ammunition and
The pad and the pen is the artillery
You finna see me blow these niggas mind with
On top of the beat it’s proper execution with my timing combined with impeccable delivery flipping the instrumental when I'm finna beat anybody struggling to keep up with the rhythm should consider early retirement
I’ve been on my level way before twisting was even popular
How could you not acknowledge that I’ve mastered the craft?
Hop in the booth and I’m rocking the mic and I bet I’m a spaz in a flash with the speed of a cheetah
Leave ‘em mad, if we clash
Leave a nigga down bad, when I blast
While taking off some ammo and
Break 'em off with the mass, I'ma smash
The opposition, point 'em with the Glock and
I’m the sickest, and then the quickest to jigg
When I smash on the gas
Cock in a minute I finna be when they handle me
Leave 'em wet up with the weapon
Like Yosemite Sam
And I’m a take 'em up and put on up around my gun never jams kick the metal off and I’ll shred 'em for the jealousy
Man I put it together competitors
Taking nothing for granted
I’m ready for whatever like the militia that’s on the front line
Doesn’t really matter You’re the funny type to come and seek about a nigga and you can have it fun and call it one time
And that’s how do it that mentality that I’m living with
When I’m spitting, there’s really ain’t no motherfucking punchline
When i be rocking the mic I be giving the niggas the business
And breaking them off with the lyrical heat and leaving with 'em this shit and be leaving 'em tongue tied
See we colossal, we chopping do the impossible
Hottest, there ain’t no problem
The hottest up in the in the underground
With my niggas starving , light 'em up like a blunt 'n now
No joke, shove it down, slow poke 'em around


It isn't difficult to get 'em in the middle
With a little bit of the venom, and hit 'em all up wit a bullet from a gun
(Lyrical Akuma) SplytSecond is here to show you how it's supposed to be done
You gotta be sure that ya rhymes are hot and lyrical before you decide to chop fast wit bars flaming up to melt plastic
As in immediately after you became nothing but a carcass
Put your body into a Deloaren so that you can get past it
Combative hype language, I'm honored to be spitting with rappers that're my favorite
But anybody that's wack I literally leave him neck less
The chopper that turn another to a Valentine's Day gift
Even though you gotta be dope
Your bars'll be soap y clean you'll probably choke
Get your arteries broke I got the blueprint to the chopping in my harmony flow
So an example for all of you is what I gotta be
Itty bitty piranha rappers I catch 'em in a fishin' net
Taking the opportunity I hardly ever get to wreck
You should never diss a set with the Lyrical shenron
In it summon me and you're gonna be granted a wish of death in a sec
Connected I wreck it a definite level of intricate syllable schemes Unable to escape a battle it even if it was a dream
Infinity is the number of fish in the sea so even if we murder you on a track then there is no benefit
Grabbing a hold of the clavicle snap it in half at a lateral angle
A pivotal moment in history every syllable touching the ear of the listeners
When I be spitting a rhyme and it kill 'em got all 'em jumping like Spider-Man off of the side of a building
But on the radio they would a said I was dissing 'em
On the 2nd Midwest choppers Techa N9na said to be intricate but most y'all forgot that part cause you're not that smart
In order to go down as mythical you need to be lyrical but you spitting it typical
You don't know



Toss a bitch in a bag when I’m coming hard on a track and attacking ‘em, breaking 'em off when I’m packing a chopper, the weapon
Anybody stepping on up over the mic and I’m finna slaughter you bitches, I steady be chopping up the session
Verbally pistol popping homie, now somebody finna be dropping up on the motherfucking floor when J Battle get to spraying
Leaving the holes up in your body, we dropping you like a shotty, bringing the flows and we get rowdy, we ain’t motherfucking playing
If you really wanna do it, I’m coming to set it up and take it down to the battlezone, I’m breaking you bitches off until the morning
And I’m warning you haters, you wanna fuck with J Battle? You finna get it, bitches got me madder than a fucking hornet
Through the lyrical storm and I’m loaded up to the fullest, I got the ammunition busting up at your head, I’m right above it
I continue my mission up in this game when I’m rapping off in the underground, be snapping on competition, I'ma love it, playa
Battle steadily bringing the drama and I’m packing a pump and I’m quicker to pulling my trigger, be dropping it, coming to chop and I’m steady breaking 'em, popping up off when I’m dumping up all on my enemies that’ll be gone
I be coming up bucking now steady be on it, I'm running up heavily, Battle be choking and smoking the bud, I be loving to toke on the rillo
We hitting 'em thick and I’m rolling so blowed it be getting me up on the mic and I’m flipping it, I’m gonna shine
Bitch you cannot fuck with the vision, I’m in a castle, better get yourself together, you’ll never be one of mine
Put it all up on the line, steady be running up outta time, everybody out here slipping, but pimping, I’m in my prime
And all you haters finna suffer divine and up in the night we got you praying to the heavens and waiting up for the sign
When I’m flipping up underground, we taking up over the music, we coming too deadly with it bashing you bitches up in the mind
I’m foreverly popping up under the ground, when I’m chopping up all in my path and I’m dropping, I’m smashing it, bringing out some of the wrath, I’m on my grind

Ripping I'mma kill 'em when I get 'em with the chopper with cleaver people can't compete
With the evil in my body, pop a shotty, hit the moon
Whenever the fuck we get this I'mma merk this beat
Dumping with the millimeter, feeling the evil
Keeping it iller, cause the feeling so real
Steady be trying to keep my sanity still
So we off of the rocker like Amityville on top of the multiple personalities
Cutting up under the pavement, I'm making a statement while holding the megaphone
(DIE BITCHES)
What I gotta do to prove it rocking with the greatest  people on the beat to ever bust rhymes
Choppa kill the punchline, when it's time
Suit up and pop up and puff on my buddha
My crew had you stupid I swoosh up I stomp on my Air Force One
Representing the motherfucking underground off of the dope shit
Kill 'em with the, fill 'em with the, venom when I deal 'em and get 'em when I hit 'em witcha
Horrorcore in my DNA, chopper just an easier name to say
Quicker like I bury and they run around in circles then they see me when they lookin' they don't speak it
They don't get it but I get it never ever ever know you can do some big when I get to bumping but I see you need
Don't test this hellishness, cats up out of the southwest
Motherfucking Mental Cases chopping it up
You better believe, you better hear the name all over the US, eventually worldwide
Steady chopping, keep my flow complex
Psikosis drop like a bomb chest
.50 cal you're wearing the wrong vest
Mental Cases going off like a bomb threat


No beat is a hostage i spit toxic; eat 'em alive when choppin i'm labeled cautious when killing
With a million syllables leaving a verse full and critical cause i'm an invincible lyrical criminal super up'd villain
And i be chopping it up wit the rhythm holding the title of a killa gorilla
Born in the wild steppin and wreckin any village; chopzilla
Go getta in the middle of any season ta deepen the reason of a breathin
Demon beating the weaken; seeking the dream eating the beats to pieces
I'ma bad mother chopper dropping the heat and don’t ever call me a dreamer cause
This nigga dont believe in sleep
When most be day dreamin believin on what they thank, i be grinding and defining how i eat by murdering 16's
And I'm wit a team of some beast teethin lookin for some blood and they call me that mizury and I'ma little bit mizunderstood
And i don't give a damn ill throw a temper tantrum; chucky of the rap game when i put my chucky on
I'm tested with the best ta wreck ta rest that’s left when taken their breath from they chest when the Midwest chants progress
Making you possessed when spitting venom and the rhythm compress like i'm a snake striking my prey looking for who’s next
Well catch a case when the makin the AK mix wit the base so don’t thank we ca-nt; we’ll fill a page and define slaughter
I treat beats like enemies when I'm bringin the misery and properly murder a verse like a real underground chopper
Tech N9ne decided we to grimey for the world wide wit our fire so he hired a rap god over real monsters
Cuz when it comes to this quick shit; our tongue spits in tongues bitch cuz will lyrically paint a picture like an author
I load 'em up when i be unloadin' a clip and demolish shit; my targets ain't hard ta miss when i be equipped wit these lips
I take part in hip-hop anonymous stomping like a hippopotamus being confident shaking and breaking ya beds ta wake you up bitch



Check out the method cause nobody could ever see in the fire
Spitting when I deliver I make it seamless
Call it dark and sick, nobody will compete and the reason for that is I'm attacking and I'mma spit it like a genius
Packing it up get up and go, Undaground Chopping keep it, then I had to let 'em know
Mind racing you know exactly what I'm saying
Cause I'm coming up out the rubble and they know that I'm not playing
Spazzing, on and off the track cause I've been having a bunch of flashbacks
And then it felt like I was slacking
But now I'm finna take it worldwide for my home, PHI all the way up to the BI, shut it down
When I'm stepping in technically better than veterans
Tactical method leaving 'em severed and dead again
But I'm thinking of breaking the game down, and pumping it with great sound
Because there is a lot of motherfuckers that I hate now
Drop a nigga head down, murder weapon isn't present
I just got a call from the president and he said to keep
Killing it with the verses and wrecking 'em
So I had to take out all the people defending 'em
(breath)
They would tell me ""Try the label"", leave 'em spinning like a dreidel
I'm not the one that you wanna get into it with
We got Eddie and my nigga Bliss
Leaving 'em dead in the ditch
Hitting my phone, ready to go
With just the flick of the wrist
Hacking a pack of the rappers with the fast gat, wooh
Pull up on 'em and I got 'em cracking like a bad back
Spaz rap, my flow, you ain't even half that
Had to cut 'em off because they only wanna follow where the cash at
Fraction, cut it like a record for the record I get solely independent, repping a record label with creative freedom
Lyrically nobody has a dead capacity or capability to beat 'em, it's Kohn



Concluded, it was better for me to stay secluded
What it takes to do it, gotta be the killer included
Polluted 'em with fury, the realer people are stupid
They potent to be diluted, I pull up and getting to it
Dynamic, I send a mendable pendant pushing the envelope
They pull and talk get in yo face trying pretend that they gon'
Play you on the daily but really not within them
They not accountable criminal on a different note
Niggas extraordinary, general we assembling
We deeper, we chopping, we take the top and we come and get 'em we gon' dominate them
You duck, keep 'em on the minimal
Confiscate the crown and the crowd has spread the ten of them
Me and my headers hit the scene to show you the pinnacle
Hit the weed, I'm everywhere man it's making me miserable
I gradually gradutated to the roll of the general
Criminal agitated with you hoe individuals
Now somebody about to get it cause I'm in the mood
Thickest niggas come and go you know I don't move
Watch 'em keep watching my plans we got different views
And I gotta keep washing my hands like I'm fixing food
Fictional fools sipping the old news
Sipping the pro-2's laying shit at your whole crews
Spitting the flows, true from the critics and nobles
When I'm in murder mode, I got a couple of go-to's
Let it go just get up off of my ballsack
Get to chopping going over the top of your ball cap
Pulling like it was on and again fall back
Don't nobody know what it is, they never knew what to call that
Chain reacts that brain making 'em all scat
Shaking up the cover, there's something more when ya'll rap
Blink up a match then I get to buzzing what ya'll lack
Break up a happy homie cause your lady just saw that


Look around
There’s somebody keeping a keeper breaking apart, until they believe we’re
Coming and bringing a beat that we watching 'em, showing and shoving to up onto
The balls we’re coming to hurt, and I be making a fucker start breaking and
Stuttering, couldn’t believe they’re following thinking “I’m sicker breaking
The bottom, fucking the liberal, look at him target it, look at him ducking it
Making it a pick it up and getting him poignant” Toppin the clip and I’m coming
To get 'em get whatever and I’m getting the time and I’m packing it all and I’m
Making it over when I’m making it blow and I’m making it part of me, Smoking it
By the jumbo giving the fuckers, I’m bringing 'em all so I can they gotta get
Down when I’m bringing 'em over, breaking that summer, breaking them over
Making it crumble, breaking the coma, making it wickeder, making a massacre
Making a vision, making him passing it till I’m tripping it up with the phone, I
Don’t give it, anybody I’m sicker and I’ll be picking it up, but I’ll be taking
The pick and then making a bottle and not giving a fuck, I’m shaking a bottle
We making 'em piss and I’m making it, how do we be in the bucket and making it
Gotta be back on the mic and I’m making a packet, I'm chopping 'em up when I'm
Making the slaughterings, I’d consider being the blacker making it probable and
Giving a syllable, breaking 'em over and taking the loss and we’re taking 'em
Over, they could not be from them, we’re fucking 'em over, they bringing 'em
Over, then come in chopping, breaking the possible burning in, making it
Making 'em taking a busting and making 'em holler, making 'em pick it, making 'em
Pick it, picking it cause I’m coming to hit 'em, sicker than when I come up and was
Hitting up in them, but I thought it wasn’t you, hope that we’re popping the
Clip when I get up, and you cannot believe that we’re making the ritual, If I
Attack then you will be a ghost, Spitting my wrath that’ll eat at your soul and
You’re paying the price that’ll equal the most, then you cherish your life cause
We beat you with poles, and you thought I was nice but I’m evil at hoes, see the
Bastards, they tried when they feel lethal blows, cause we asking the pipe and
I’m seeking some more, as he’s passing it like you were drinking some dough, he
Was not, he was unconscious breathing was slow"

You rather count money or count blessings?""
Now that's a wild question
Fame turned my life upside down, I guess it was meant to be
Like passing Beyoncé a Tic-Tac, and that ain't a diss
This way more to me than a diss track
Jay-Z is God to me
Nas is God to me
Eminem is like B.I.G. and Pac to me
And if you disagree I hope you bleed hypocrisy
And this'll be the realest shit I ever wrote
Shoutout to all the crazy bitches
I've been involved with
Thank y'all for making my wife a crazier bitch than y'all bitches
Y'all might've lost me, but y'all win
And this'll be the realest shit I ever wrote
Now let's talk about the BET Awards
When Kanye went to the podium for the win
And mentioned everyone in the same category as him but me and Em
He said they motivated him and normally that would be ammo to hate on him
But that ain't my M.O!
My M.O. is to be mo' motivatin'
This new-wave culture is so cultivatin'
Where the fuck do I fit in?
And this'll be the realest shit I ever wrote
I've succumb so much to this game I feel sorrow
I answer more questions about the 40 and Game squabble
Than I answer questions that I ask myself
""Are you a good father?""
The answer's, ""Well... fuck this
Royce got a game tomorrow""
I ain't gotta spell out the offers
If being famous means speaking to people in offices
Over being there for your sons and daughters...
I'm off this...
I know the last couple of lines kinda fell out of the pocket
But I don't give a fuck! Let me tell you this:
When was the last time you copped some shit
Where it actually came out of your pocket?
Answer that! If I got to answer questions from you
You got to answer questions from me!
I'm fucking my whole life up for you, answer this question:
""What the fuck are you doing for me?"", answer that!
Still I love my fans, even though y'all looking at me like I'm just a drunk nigga
That's just throwing up behind shit, blowing up, but nigga I ain't throwing up shit but my hands
And this is just me growing up

Or is that just another fuckin' excuse?
Do I do it for attention cause I crave it, I won't mention it, I'll save it
If you know me than you know a nigga treasure anonymity
Nigga thought that as a man, you must be kiddin' me
And I'm starting to feel like my fans are now condemning me
Listen, I don't owe y'all shit
Same Joe I am today is the same Joe y'all get
Y'all will interrupt a nigga while he at his place of worship
And think that came along with your 20 dollar purchase
You bought the music, not the nigga that made it
But let me touch up on that nigga that made it
If you're judging me on actions then I'll take that L every time
If you conclude ""Joe Budden is a corny mah'fucker""
Cause all it mean if I'm a corny mah'fucker
Is the greatest rapper ever's just a corny mah'fucker
My bad, I'm not as street as you
But all this time I was being me, not being you
I get behind that mic, let all my demons through
Without knowing shit about the people that I'm speaking to
Add that to me not seeing a reason to
And that says a lot in a room full of silence, listen...
At 21 I had a drug problem
At 31 still drugs is a problem
But the thing about that pill is it made everything real
And I felt I needed to see
Funny thing about it all, I ain't like what I saw
Now the Lord's voice is in my head like
""You'll be DEAD soon for questioning me""
Another lesson for me
Far greater than whatever I profess it to be
Cause if left to me, I'd put our eyes in our brains
We'd over-think what we see and our whole lives would change
But fuck it, that day had to come
Who ever knew that I would have a son?
I coulda guessed it, I was fuckin' like a rabbit
But I never saw him handle scoliosis like his dad did
Never knew me and Ronnie would talk again
Fuck a rhyme, I'm just happy that we talk again
Who knew that the second I acknowledged you
You would get terminally ill, be in the hospital
The thought of you leaving is what fucks with me
I'm scared to death of getting full custody
Nigga, I look in the mirror disgustedly
So how am I supposed to feel the day that he looks up to me?
I always said you were the worst baby-mother
I had ex-girl confused with baby-mother
And there lies my problem with our Creator
All the times I wanted her black ass dead, you wouldn't take her
Don't do it now, I need her
Understand, it don't get no realer
See how I go to bed with thoughts of a damn killer
But rather show y'all my girl through these Instagram filters
Look at her, don't look at me
Cause if y'all judging, y'all would throw the book at me
Speakin' of shorty, nah, I'll do that in private
It might be a little soon for me to let her know how I get
Shit, and now we right back at one
Real quick, let me get back to my son
When a nigga was like…
He said ""Dad, I'm weird… but I don't have a problem with that""
And I was like… I laughed, and I was like
""Well, number 1, why do you think you're weird
And number 2, why don't you have a problem with that?""
And he looked me in my eyes and he was like…
""Well, I say I'm weird, number 1, because I know I'm weird
And I don't have a problem with it because that's me
And whoever don't like it, they don't have to be around me
I'm comfortable with me and who I am""
And right there, that was cold
In my head I thought ""That was bold""
Illest shit about it all, said that at 10 years-old
So I could die right now…
I could die right now and feel like he got the most important part of Joe
Or... better than that...
I could die right now and feel like he know all he need to know
Joey
Royce, what up
Last night we cried tears of joy
This morning they were still there
What's handicap without the wheelchair
That's what we are, but fuck it...
We'll be the sacrificial lamb for y'all niggas
Hate it or love it...
Leave all of that, b, fuck it...

Yeah, man
I kinda feel where my nigga was coming from, you know
Both my niggas, you know
Baby-mom was on WorldStar and shit
You know, talkin' 'bout I don't take care of my junior
Me and my nigga straight though
Yo, my little nigga rap
I just let it be, you know, cause people get their feelings hurt over other shit
So I just let it go, you know, I ain't have no rebuttal
But uh… when you grew up fucked up
Nobody's perfect, you know, but I'm perfect for this
This rap shit, man… yeah
Eastside Long Beach: Atlantic avenue and Hill
Crooked was a youngster my ghetto attitude was real
Thumper in the waist in case I had to shoot to kill
Rocking dumb mics cause all I had was stupid skill
Eastsiders we cypher by the bus bench
Some sippin’ toca vodka, others had the blunt pitched
A lot of them niggas died, sweatshirt blood drenched
Others went to jail, they hit a lick and left thumbprints
Long beach I salute ya grind
Even though you think you I sold out you not saluting mine
I don’t come around much, I’m on music’s time
Lost and found I found when I’m broke I lose my mind
So I hustle like I’m on a hunger strike
Without a doubt when I cuff a mic
I leave a body count like the shotty’s out
Cause I’m from a group called slaughter
Rap better than everybody house
Now they think I’m in the game and stuntin’
But I’m like an orgasm man, I came from nothing
Some of you from the burbs but you claim you wasn’t
So lame you struttin’, with a cain you frontin’
Fuck all that, if I was born rich I would rhyme about it
I was born poor in a ditch, I’m rhyming tryna climb up out it
Tryna avoid a life of crime I’m ’bout it
Some say I’ll be fine without it
But I kinda doubt it
Death around the corner, prison breathing down my neck
Chasing paper til a nigga wheezing out of breath
IRS wanna fuck me, I ain't even outta debt
Said they Young Buck me, tryna squeeze me outta checks
Yeah, them fools tryna squeeze me outta checks
Don’t talk to Dominick unless you pay ya mommas rent
With marijuana sent outta town, them dollars spent
My own fam wanna grab the steel and harm me
But I got the nuts to kill an army
Word to Killa army, man all them killers adore me
BET red carpet, the steel was on me
To put a slug in my flesh and blood wouldn’t feel good
Serena crip walking at the Olympics I’m still hood
Still me, til my candle is blown
So many secrets I only told to a glass of patron
Half of my fathers family died of cancer alone
He called me sick, I didn’t answer the phone
How does it feel to know that your son doesn’t care
Cause you wasn’t there, life wasn’t fair
I look at steps in the wrong direction, another stare
Yeah muthafucka yeah
I swear, just the other muthafucking night dawg
Like niggas, niggas rolled in front of my studio on my kids life
Nah’mean, I ran through the fucking studio to my office grabbed that 3.57 thang man
Came out waving, I’m bout to bust, the police pass by
My little brothers told me I needed to chill
Nah’mean, this is what I do man, this is the life I live for real dawg
This ain't no muthafuckin’ rap music
Just the other night I coulda killed a nigga man
Nah’mean, I wouldn’t be here rapping about this shit
Think about it man

My grandmom’s left me, father don’t exist
Baby moms stress me, my momma got a cyst
My older son love football and the little nigga hands is mean
But he chronic asthmatic so he fully suited on the sideline wishing he could be in there but still
Cheering for his team
My youngest son got nerve issues, sometimes he cry to me
I’m looking at him like it’s not you fault
You was conceived when daddy was such a slave to his everyday anxiety
I worked at UPS for a week and my boss ain't have to fire me
I wasn’t fit to lift boxes I quit
Don’t put me in that box when I spit
My life wasn’t too muthafucking fly for me
Wasn’t too muthafucking fly for me
From the lobby huffing and puffing running from robbery
To Crooked I, Royce Da 5’9″, Joe Budden, homie from the Goodie Mob and me carving artistry
Celebrating escaping poverty
Ashy knees and no socks
Chinese outta hocks but that was on the first, other than that
Liver works and government sent me my yellow cheese in a box
Ya’ll ain't have that yellow cheese in a box
Last night I cried tears of joy
But the other night I cried tears my boy
No longer here I can’t hear his voice
I guess upstairs they playing dealers choice
Popped a pill with Joe I’m sippin’ clear with Royce
Crook light a cigar nigga
My little homie just hit the pen
Went in a young adult and coming out a senior citizen
And them crackers just denied me
Fuck dawg I can’t even sneak a visit in
I ain't hustlin’ no more if y’all listening
Ya’ll niggas only get the music man
Ya’ll don't know what be going on with a nigga day to day
I mean shit I ain't complaining or nothing
Like a nigga stand on his own two and hold it down
But it’s realer than you think nigga
You think I give a fuck about a rap list
I just left my condo, hopped up in my car I’m on my way to fuck an actress
I don’t need y’all to remind me bout my pen and pad gift
And how my ad-libs subtract your wack spit
Multiply my visits to Chase divide mad chips among 3 other niggas
Who spazz quick
Nah nigga this ain't no rap clique
This is a muthafucking takeover
I want another Range Rover
I got such a hangover celebrating the fact my mother became sober
My uncle fading from that needle though
Found out he fully blown a couple weeks ago
My aunt tested negative but it’s the same result
Cuz she gon die on the same day he stop breathing yo
To know me ain't to love me
Nah, to know me is to know me
Cause you ain't got to like me but respect that I ain't phony
Not a nominee for Tony’s or Oscars for my uh bologna
What you see is what you get
Hope you getting what you see cause what you seeing is a threat
Come at me with indirect’s, I ain't gon write a song about you
I’mma knee you in your neck
And then write a song about how I just beat you half to death
Don’t play with my little niggas
I’m just a grown ass man tryna feed my family through the talent God gave me
Honestly I don’t care if you hate me
But don’t fuck with my money
Anything else I say will be dry snitching on myself, how dumb would that be

I know that you'll thank God you did

I know you're the reason I believe in life

Cumicu,Double Penetration,rap,"Uh, look
I’m the reason this lame’s name's ringing
The same reason the gauge in his face breathing
I’ve maintained with the same demons
I can not explain what has got in his brain thinking that we even
This the creek he’s knee deep in
It’s that heat seeking piece squeezed and released then repeated
Brush em with the stick and street sweep em’
Then I let em’ ride into the sky like that scene that ET in, uh
It’s easy in telling they’ll see what his belly is when it's cropping up his top like Ezekiel Elliott
Leaving him bleeding and swelling in need of medic
To treat what I’ve evilly set in his mid-sec when I point five
Boy’s lie, numbers don’t, your lines suck as quotes
And If you’re thinking the scores tied, I’m cutting rope
Seeing Em tore with his Dog, they’ll be up in smoke
Call the Doc, and I'll Kurrupt them both
Cause on the bill, they’ll know what the cause be like Cliff Huxtable
It’s nothing to get him peeled till he sleeps cause it’s comfortable
What’s up with you?
Porter's so unoriginal that even sending direct shots at him will sound subliminal
I’m killing you, it can officially be seen
Two niggas in his group, and his initials DP?
He love that double penetration, double penetration
And since he loves it, yo, the gun has got a couple waiting
Blue Steel, got him screaming like a faggot should
Loose SEAL as you can see he likes grabbing wood
He be getting anal raped over 808’s
Fans supporting defeat stronger than an Ankle brace
I take no breaks, these here, lines fracture
A mere sign there’s a nearby linebacker
I spare mine then divide after, so do the math
'Cause what you lack is a clear prime factor, uh
What you’re getting’s finger licking’, triggers squeeze
Ammunition’s hitting quick as niggas sipping newer lean
With a Breez, that’s a bullet pass fast through the seam
You will see it flash through your head and dab, that’s a dream, my nigga
You’re going shot for shot looking up to God?
These ain’t suburban street bars for a Mardi Gras
I'll Fire off at your empire for an hour long
To stop the rounds you'll need Armani to cut the power off
Does he really want to get this work? 'Cause I’ll put him in the dirt with ease
On a murder spree when I kill him in the first degree with an urgency
So it’s really going to hurt his team when they gotta get a nigga diggin' a hole in the ground
'Cause I’m holding it down for the Rhode in my town when I’m doing this Hercules' light work for free
All of you niggas who wanted it with me I’m bucking it quickly
A hundred and fifty in every one of you suffering under my privy
I’m steadily running my city, I’m one of the hungriest niggas to come from the grittiest sections ever that I’ll never be worried to get to blessin' when it comes to the fury of God!

The silver medal like I happened to lose
But it’s the deuce that I happily choose
Masked up, using gloves
‘Cause you was dumb, this shot’s for the back of ya toof, but you—

By the way they cheering back, to a look of deceit
Man' your wack fans laughed and gassed up what had put me to sleep
Just embrace what it took for the cheese from those pearly whites

He suck’s with his arms more than octopus

Wearing the T shirt and jeans with all that gel in his hair
That’s not fair, but I guess it’s just the way that it goes
If you don’t have reservations, then you better know the host
Otherwise, be advised, they’ll throw you out with the trash
Back in the cold, you’ll be beggin' for scraps

They welcome everybody come from near and far

Pay two quid for your entry fee
I glide into the arena, ecstasy
When you were seven you didn't realise
Most of the adults were stoned out of their eyes
Some jacked up on the seats around the edge
Others were so fucked that they turned into veg
I didn't care cos I made my pledge
Rollskating at Maskell's got respect


I used to listen to Public Enemy
Erik B and Rakim and BVSMP
But before that, in 1983
I'd go breakdancing after my tea
Down the youth club, eating the fruit pastels
Saturday morning I'd go down to Maskell's
It was my favourite place to go
Dancing all day at the Rollerdisco


Ne-ne-ne-ne-ne-ne-ne-ne-ne-nineteen eighty three

When Maskells is over it's out on your bike
Doing bunny hops and wheelies if you like
Nicking from the shop and comparing your Nike
Dropping bricks onto trains was a delight
Then I'd find a weak kid and have a fight
Use your pocket money to buy a head band for the night
From Fussels, Newport's health-sports store
This is the stuff I used to do before draw
Paul Hardcastle, ne-ne-nineteen
Was always played on the rollerdisco scene
I would listen to music 'til I went deaf
Skating around backwards to Axel F
Even back then I was still wearing gold
They had an ice rink upstairs, so I was told
It was ecstasy going round a pillar
Doing a special dance to Michael Jackson's 'Thriller'

You-You-You-You-You-You-You-You-You fuckin' knows it

Ne-ne-ne-ne-ne-ne-ne-ne-ne-nineteen eighty three


Eating cola cubes and watching Grange Hill
Riding my chopper to the Chip shop in Pill
I didn't know words like Cunny or Vag
Getting my 200 metres swimming badge
Back then you were seven, I was eight
I only just started to masturbate
When I was in school the days went slow
Cos I was dreaming of a fuckin' rollerdisco

I didn't smoke, I didn't drink booze
I collected star wars stickers and bubble gum tattoos
Stuck 'em on my face cos it made me feel hard
Then popped into the shop to buy some football cards
Finished the album, Panini '83
Get back home in time for the A-Team and tea
Then watch Bullseye, and Saint and Greavsie
Then go to bed, 'til tomorrow, see?


I watch the A-Team and Airwolf too
Before I found drugs and started sniffing glue
Riding round the lane on my Grifter or my Chopper
Even back then I was a hip-hopper"

I'll be there anytime

Hanging on to every grudge I think I need to hold
Can't remember who I'm even fighting anymore
You'd think I'd know my way by now
(But I'm lost and...) Now I can't be found


And I’ve been wrong

Wrong enough to say I'm sorry
Owning up to things I can't undo

Making a poo

I'd like to gypsy-lift the stars
And send one out to you
You, who are you
Someone with no dandruff
Perhaps brown eyes a derelict
A dandy

I'm out shopping in my canoe
Finger frolicking the fireflies
Finger fucking firewood
Spying on the masturbating snails
Hollyhocks and cat tails
Boneless jelly fish and whales
Perhaps I'll meet you then
On the decadent horizon
Where young lovers lock lips
Looking at the lockness monster

Phooey, phooey, hence cabluey

Tevé,Banana,pop,"From time to time I dream that I'm a manatee
Undulating underneath the sea
Unshackled by the chains of idle vanity
A modest manatee, that's me

I look just like a chubby, brown banana-tee
As I nose along the cozy ocean floor
Immune from human folly and inanity
That's why a manatee is such a happy herbivore

I'm a manatee, I'm a manatee
I'm every bit as wrinkled as my grann-atee
No difference between my face and fann-atee
A noble manatee, that's me

With the dietary habits of a manatee
I never fail to lick my platter clean
I sprinkle seaweed on my raisin bran-a-tee
The perfect manatee cuisine

With my wit, sophistication, and urbanity
I dignify my watery domain
No one near will ever hear me use profanity
Because a manatee has his image to maintain

I'm a manatee, I'm a manatee
I keep my reputation spick and span-atee
No difference between my face and fann-atee
A stately manatee, that's me
You might also likeEncumbered by my lumbering gigan-atee
I'm thought to be an ocean-going brute
The least appealing creature on the planet-ee
But to a manatee, I'm cute

I prefer my world of silence and of sanity
But my underwater friends don't all agree
For whenever I am dreaming I'm a manatee
Somewhere a manatee is dreaming that he's me

I'm a manatee, I'm a manatee
Outside the fold of boring old humanity
No difference between my face and fann-atee
I'm a roly-poly, jelly-rolly, sugar-bowly
Heart-and-soully manatee, that's me!"

Somewhere along the line

I know my brothers they got love
All my brothers they got love for me
And they put they trust in me

And I put my trust in them
Only brothers ain’t got friends
No cutting throats while shaking hands

The question that you never seem to ask, I wanna know
How I react with beams and MACs? Lil' woadie kick a door
She just want some diamonds, flooded from her head to toe
Call it perfect timin', on her left wrist, AP froze
And overtimin', clock keep chimin', I think it's my time to go
Dollar signs and he don't mind it, cookin' over stoves

I just gotta reassess, they know this million-dollar check (Paol Trizzy maced it, bro)
Bae, I need to see you for this evenin', I can't get no rest
She just want some diamonds, no, she don't want no more of me
Baby, you the finest, I just want some loyalty
I switched up her stylin', Balenciaga, Jordan sneaks
I swear that all these police sirens really paranoin' me


Relocate, I switch the tone on 'em, I'm a dope boy
They done even took my phone number on the task force
I can't even speak on my homie, makin' no noise

Oh Lord, Lil' Pluto, that's my woadie, woadie, in the Goyard
Lil' Pluto, that's my woadie, forty in the Goyard
24K like Kobe, got a gold and cold heart
Helicopter crash out, I remember last time
I done really ran my racks up, now I could bring that cash out
I feel like the bad guy, how long we gon' last now?
I could see me all in Aspen, sippin' on this Amstel
Now I got the last laugh
You gave me no chance, you threw my city in the trash can
F-150, word around the city, we got bags, and
I could get them birdies for the cheap, it's by the gas station (Paol Trizzy maced it, bro)

You laugh and spit in our face
What a mistake your heart has made
There'll be no hiding place


You've deceived us

You can't hope to survive
You haven't got a chance
If you are caught alive


Word is on the street
That you will leave for good
Nobody wants to see you

Consequences could be grave
Hers is a love you cannot win

I'd rather die
Than say goodbye

Got a rapper, I'm 'bout to put him in the trunk

Yeah it's gettin' kinda scary now
Chasin' these racks 'til they whole like Jerry now
Couple niggas in the club play stare me down
Ten racks, no talk, them niggas buried now


Atlantic nervous, tick tock on the watch
Career was hangin' by a thread, then it popped
Pop, I dropped ""Coco,"" now I'm on top
Of the mountain, it makes sense when you move rock
Couple of A&Rs hated, but that ain't work
All this bullshit cause niggas ain't sign me first
So hell nah, I don't trust these niggas
And Game gave a nigga game, told me, ""Fuck these niggas""
Underdog on the west, now I got fame
I must've had a dirty diaper cause that shit changed

Put the trees upside down, check the hangtime
Last time an opp died, I was on a plane flyin'
Ironically we was in the sky at the same time
These niggas tired of gettin' killed, tell 'em take five
Nigga, I been payin' bills since I was yay high
I took a lot of niggas in, they tried to take me out
You'd fuck with me if you knew what I made it out
They hit the block yesterday, we just changed the house
He had a plan before he died, but he laid the route
Two hundred pounds at one time, we gon' save the drought
I know you left it up to me, we gon' make it count
This for Crumbles


Money conversations, this the plug, don't hang the phone up
Knock a nigga daddy down before the sun up
We specialize in walkin' niggas down, so don't run up (My nigga Lee, I think we got another one)
Put fifty cent on every nigga that's your young buck
Three-five in every Backwood, I know my lungs fucked
Ghetto baby, swing them choppers like some nunchucks
Them niggas ain't no killers, they some young pups
Them niggas' pockets worth four thousand, they got one cup"

So I'd rather stay at home
Be sexy and all alone

I'm having a dry day, nothing to say

Passion, pain, and demon slayin’

Vinnie Paz,Urban Gorillas,rap,"Yeah, fuckin' Vinnie Paz daddy!
Necronomicon on the track!
Yo!



Hey yo Sabacolypse, I brought a lot of Glocks and lots of clips
Up in the caravan with Taliban who cock the fifth
Bush ran from a war and straight ducked that
Bush wanna send me to war? I say fuck that!
We war and buck back with the cannon or knife
'Cause Vinnie Paz ain’t have a problem with Iran in his life
And I ain’t got a problem stabbing up your man with a spike
But I got a problem murdering a man and his wife
For some land that I ain’t never even stand in my life
For a man who couldn’t tell you what abandonment’s like
Been scammed all my life, from Reaganomics to the crack war
And y’all are wondering what we run around with gats for
All I ask for is a good night’s sleep
So I pray to Allah hoping that the hood might eat
Each one teaches ones but the hood like beef
But I’m a hypocrite daddy so I pull my heat


You might also likeWe fighting a war, in the jungle of the ghetto
Your life will be gone, once we hurt you with the metal
We blast at the system, bang for the streets
Urban gorillas motherfuckers, hanging the beast!



We urban gorillas on the move like Durban Africa
We the masses that practice tactics right outta Attica
We blast at you, catch you for hostage, torture demons
For all the bleeding we must have war before freedom
Y’all fiending and loathing, hopes to reach an atonement
We’ll have peace in a moment after we beat our opponents
We jonesing like Jonestown Massacre, the White Knight
Forcing suicides, spike your soft drinks with cyanide
Call it payback, for what you made and inflicted
We live in a world, being lead by racists and bigots
We stripped the land from the natives and chose to call them Americans
Then claimed it as ours as if they forfeit inheritance
It’s evident intelligence and weapons become medicine
We’ll overthrow the devils in power and move ahead of them
Yeah we veterans from poverty, we rocking the streets
Freedom and equality come when we conquer the beast!




With the right to bear arms I’m excited to throw one
Q the Urban Gorilla, Brooklyn’s Mighty Joe Young
That faces the firing squad that’ll spit on three
Screaming till my death, “King Kong ain’t got shit on me!”
I beat on my chest with the game of a Silverback
I don’t fire warning shots, take aim with a killer gat
Them peace talks and rallies will get so far
Fight the most powerful imperialists in the name of Elizam Escobar
Guerrilla warfare training camps in the projects
Shoot up soft then stop like climb the staircase till your heart rate progress
I spit possessed by the soul of Albizu
Lead rips through your chest till the welfare let go of my people
I was raised in the Bronx, Congo jungle
Where the Ball Busters and Zulus locked in a mondo rumble
And you could lose your gold over a Bronco fumble
And the CIA faggots interrogate your sidekick until your Tonto crumble




Yeah Q-Unique!
It's fuckin' Vinnie Paz baby!
Sabacolypse! Sabacolypse!
Gorillas in the Mist!
Non Phixion!
Necronomicon, Psycho+Logical-! It's all dirt baby!
Prepare for war!
Philly to Brooklyn!
Boogie Down!
What's y'all mothafuckas want, it's all dirt, it's all grime baby, it's all ugly! What's the fuckin' deal?
Psycho+Logical- mothafucka!
Ah, we don't fuck around we punch you in the fuckin' mouth daddy!
Q-Capital!
Yeah, Sabac! Aiight? Vinnie Paz! Aiight?
Urban Gorillas!
Urban Gorillas daddy!
Mothafuckas!
It's Necro on the track, Psycho+Logical-! Ugly Grinch shit, dirty!
Yeah!

Big Doggy,Rejected,rap,"Yo Eastwood  (Yo what up Gotti?)
Niggas act like bitches, wanna hear the truth?
Before I say another word, motherfuck Snoop
DoggHouse eat a big Dogg Pound dick
This Gotti, you ain't gon' pimp slap shit
I'm cool, calm, and I'm so collective
And you niggas don't respect shit, nigga
They call you Soopafly, I call you Soopa-cape
Y'all niggas bring the gorillas I done ate
They call you Soopafly, I call you Soopa-bitch
That love to eat a Snooper-duper super dick
Panties and a cape, little pink panties
I drink Hennessy motherfucker
And I'm somebody you don't wanna see motherfucker
I'm lookin' in the streets and I see you niggas truant
And I'm ridin' without Simon's influence motherfucker..


I roll these streets with my mind on G's, and I keep a Glock tucked
Low-key on my body for niggas that's tryin' to kill me
Shit, I'm out the hood too
From the Eastside to Compton to Inglewood too
I'm Eastwood (Who?)
One of the realest livin', existin', lyricist lynchin'
I'm competition brought to collision, I flow with percision
Decision to end it, I spit with a vengeance
So pay attention homie, it's business
Can't die without my tickets
I'm ballin', boss hoggin', Snoop doggin'
I'm stompin' out your braids with my Chuck's
A outlaw with a thug ministry, chemistry, touched by my memory
Hennessy, from here to Italy got niggas feelin' me
Sun roof open, so I can feel the wind blow
Smokin' dodie, blowin' out my H2 limo
Ain't never had a demo, I'm choppin' up albums
Lock me in a booth, I'm a beast, turn up the value
You might also like
Smoke a blunt with Mr. Cooper, super trooper, pop - Snoop and Soopa
I'm so fly, I roam the block and I'm ready to die
Niggas told me what happened but they never really told me why
These streets is real, I've seen my O.G.'s cry
Bodies outlined with chalk, that's where a dope fiend died
Soldiers who can't hold they own won't make it alive
I got a lot of talent, so I ain't hard to find
I'm on the grind, my squad ain't far behind
We mackin' dimes, in the club packin' nines
Sniffin' lines - that cocaine blow your mind
Fuckin' with mine, I'm bringin' mine
Bring yours nigga!..


Ease the beast, Gotti supreme
Gail posted in the back of the 'Llac on lean
Keep the heat stashed in the dash when we mash
Like livin' fast it's secondary to cash
Get your vest tested, your chest infected
Roll with Tha Row now my flow's respected
Gotti up and left, never was rejected
Ride 'til I die 'til the game's respected, bitch


I ain't said shit, done shit, fuck 'em
Bustin', bust in bustin', dumpin', fuck 'em - gangsta
What the fuck you really ever did? - nothin'
What the fuck you really ever done?"

You’ve got too much on the line


Once you’ve got something to lose
You don’t waste your time dealing with a fool who got something to prove
When you learn to live under them rules
You’ll maneuver like a boss do, never be corrupted or used


Don’t hang with people who don’t want nothing
No hustle, no drive, won’t ever own nothing
You grew up in the same hood, ‘round the same age
You started grinding, now you good, he at the samе stage
Can’t force a grown person out thеir playing-games phase
You done read the whole book, they on the same page
When you was younger, you used to see him go steal and rob
Called you a square because you went out there and got a job
That was your homie, but he blind, he did a little time
He thirty-nine, still got a twenty year old mind
A wise soul ain’t attracted to the fool’s gold
You pay a car note, a mortgage and buying school clothes
So why would you ever jeopardize the place you in?
People with nothing will provoke and try to bait you in
You let ‘em get into your head, all your work is dead
Why would you risk it all over what a person said?

I gotta make it home, I got people that need me
He talked reckless so you popped him at his front door
You doing fifty years but you ain’t no punk though
See, understand, homie, once you start to get some things
Folks hating and talking ‘bout you don’t hit the same
Ain’t no more getting out of character and flipping out
Y’all could be outside all you want, I’m in the house
You got your life together, black, you ain’t the same cat
Now you on lock behind some childishness, explain that
They say you s’posed to pick your battles, yeah they told you a fact
You got property, all they got is just the clothes on his back
You got a family, you got babies, you done found your place
See, birds fly, they don’t slither on the ground with snakes
Yeah, both of y’all might take a fall tossing them words

Y’all be talking loyalty and how you mob for your crew
But what you didn’t learn to do is to be loyal to you
Them your partner drugs, why you tryna test your fate?
Ain’t nothing gangster ‘bout taking somebody else’s case
Right or wrong, it’s smarter to do your thing alone
Because if he really a soldier, he gon’ claim his own
And when you know the game, you never hesitate to give it
‘cause by the time you learn the lesson, it’s too late to live it
Too many people got dropped that coulda talked it out
Some road rage and getting popped over a parking spot
You say they in the hood hating on you, I don’t care
You in your purpose, why the hell you even ‘round there?
They're mad at you because you straight and they ain’t made a dime
A basic thinker ain’t in line with elevated minds
And that don’t mean that you forgot the hood and turned your back
You only turned your back on them crash dummy acts
I’m speaking facts so

Once you’ve got something to lose
You don’t waste your time dealing with a fool who got something to prove
When you learn to live under them rules
You’ll maneuver like a boss do, never be corrupted and used (again)
Once you’ve got something to lose

Nef The Pharaoh,When,rap,"""I love you baby"" – what I said in my head
But actually we argued right before we went in the bed
I needed to walk, we’re five minutes down from park
Threw on my hoodie I'm from Bridgeport I ain't scared of the dark
Jamaican wearin’ my Timbs but I'm debatin’ the Clarks
That's just my inner brand consultant always playin’ its part
Whateva though, it ain't the time to be correctional
I'm just so all about my business bredren too professional
But anyway I check the door, make sure it was locked
Last thing I need is “Killer Mike” roamin’ my spot
Hot, a lot of degrees under my tee
Took my Berkeley sweater off and just hung it right on a tree
I'll be back for it, just steppin’ out around the corner
Made sense at the time we could debate it if you wanna
Kept on walkin’ down the street was feelin’ like a sauna
Saw another dude across from me runnin’ and so I pondered
“He must've did somethin’""
I should've prayed but secretly I had cheered for him
""Run Forrest!""
Freestyled a song for him even made up a chorus
Wanderin’ along didn't wonder why I was in a forest


Gazin’ at the Milky Way just tryna get away
Walkin’ thru Lake Merritt, summertime in the Bay
Ate a Milky Way in my pocket from yesterday
Walkin’ thru Lake Merritt, summertime in the Bay

Ran into Marco, y'all know Marquito
Mexican heritage, speaks spanish poquito
Met him at New Parish when Nef the Pharaoh was playin’
Learned he DJs but in the mornin’ works at Days Inn
Casually puffin’ a spliff, ""You wanna hit?""
Must've forgot since 2011 I been legit
Quickly reminded him he responded, “No pressure”
That's what I respect about him, he respects my gesture
Dapped up, doin’ black stuff, now I'm tapped in
Walkin’ while we talkin’, we ‘round the backend
Pushers, half-naked hookers, they was baggin’
This the type of gram that I don't wanna be tagged in
Marco laughin’, ""Yo bruh just relax man
You ain't narco but I’ll second guess how you actin’”
One chick, Cinnamon Stick, she tryna lap dance
""Nah yo I’m married"" ""Babyboy, who was askin’?""
“Woah no no no no!” I back up ‘til my back hits a table in a corner
Knocked over the marijuana
Man they hollered just like how pack of wolves howl at the moon
""Uhh I think I should start leavin’ soon""


Feelin’ trapped, I don’t know what to say
Just here at Lake Merritt, summertime in the Bay
Lookin’ at Marquito he won't even look my way
Call Me Ace – this might be my last night in the Bay
…yo so Ace what happened?
…aight


Moment of silence, to my surprise
A person that shall remain nameless gave me five
Told me, ""It's whatever bruh, we not gon ride
Plus I love what you and Sean T did with Positive Vibes""
""Oh fsho! I'm glad you bumpin’ me""
Started rappin’ the chorus everyone joined the company
Minus one dude starin’ at me really awkwardly
I had this inner feelin’ like ""yo bredren what you want from me""
His eyes looked like black holes I couldn't read ‘em
Behind his clothes two four-fours I couldn't peep ‘em
At this point all our hands high to the Most High
That's when he chose to unload and let them slugs fly
Had to duck like Daffy, obviously he wasn't happy
‘Bout my performance or action, this another type of clappin’
Cinnamon tried to grab me I left her in the dust
It's already hard to explain this hope my wife ain't woken up
I got stopped, two plain-clothed undercover cops
“Aww great! Now I'm fsho gettin’ shot!”
They told me “Freeze!” like ain't no gunshots in the back
I tried to tell em I’m a Berkeley-Haas graduate but they laughed
I wanted to obey they wishes as these bullets whizzin’ past
I got my hands still high screamin’, ""Jesus, here's my last!""
One cop blast, a couple shells went through my arm
I saw blood then I paused that's when I heard the alarm
…I love you baby"
Flight Distance,Background Noise,rap,"My generation was raised by a cyclops, with rabbit ears
With frequencies bouncing through the atmosphere
To a luminous cube, and its components and parts

To a luminous cube, and its components and parts
Will have us glued to the tube, until we glow in the dark


Am I watching this television or is it watching me devolve?
I keep control with this remote that I hold in my greedy palms
I learnt my mannerisms, propaganda-driven chained to my seat
Suffered aneurysms and I'm living face to face with defeat
No defense against the schizophrenic time-bandit
I try frantic and live damn it my adversary's gigantic
Capillaries fried and it's the fault of myself
I got cross-eyed friends with cataracts it altered their health
Always created a malaise amazed with lazy education
My baby's wasting baby weight and as we're facing devastation
No reparations could evade or change the damage done
The revolution will be televised, for disadvantage though man
Put your remote hand up if you're fed up with the subliminal
And keep it up if you're a fucking individual
TV killed my attention span so I raise the sword
And face the Lord as I hang myself with the cable cord

I smashed my TV, why? 'Cause it was laughing at me
With a saccharine sweet cackle that gave me battle fatigue
Just grapple with channel 16, it's been babbling it seems
Before Adam and Eve were reaching snatching apples from trees
Land on my feet flat, at the sand of the beach
And sunk deeper than the fathoms of the Caspian Sea
Though our thoughts were going back now to the chattering screen
With every wave that crashed on shore the sound of static increased
Fingers, snapped to my cheek to bring me back from a dream
But it seemed this was reality I was actually seeing
Evil traps and deceits, networks planted magical beans to have their stocks shoot past the clouds, at its maximum peak
Crowds flock en masse to the screen almost too tranquil to breathe
They catch a glimpse of Avril Lavigne and Pamela Lee
And half of these teens believe all that the camera sees
And can't even read unless it's close caption TV"

:
About a year ago a nigga Ronnie Ron
Put us down from the storm 'cause these other Young Soldierz with a lotta heart
Niggas wearin' colors but instead they say they claim
So we did a whole album, showed them bustas how to gangbang
And to my homies in my hood, yo, I told ya
Hunters 'til I die, Frontline, I'm a Soldier
Bitches wanna jock 'cause I'm paid
But I stay high 'til I die, catch a fade
I, depend and I'm still blazin' humps
Niggas wanna diss?
The reason that a nigga whole tape bumps
But I'm the one who gives a fuck
And watch a dump truck, dumped deep down yo' throat 'til my dick stuck
Now who's the one wit' more problems wanna come to the funk?
Boom, got a nigga down for pumpin' the trunk
And then we let the whole world know it's hard to be me
And who I be is Lil' Stretch, a SOLDIER

The P-O-P gives a fuck about a bitch when I bury ya
Set tripper, .44 Desert Eagle carry ya
Before I take a loss, there's bodies I step
Hat to the back, still twisted off the 'Gnac
I give up the doves when I bell in
Funked-off, 5 to the 7, back to the Leven?
Dangerous the crew, why yes the click
Indo I'm smokin', keep a nigga chokin'
Now Pops said it's on and it's poppin'
Yes I fold ya, we Young Soldierz
Yeah, my niggas

Comin' up a young nigga was broke
But I got my hustle on the Watts slangin' dope
See a young nigga like me I got big nuts
Hooked up with the Dangerous Crew and drivin' big cuffs
The one time wanna hold a young nigga back
Is it 'cause my pockets fat?
Or 'cause niggas wear Starter hats?
'Cause everytime I hit the projects
I'm gettin' sweated by the homies with the rednecks
And search my car, now they in my stash spot
And funk the zone, a Glock 16 shot
Bararow was the sound when he pulled the trigger
Welcome to the Eastside, nigga!

Say he tryna front but that bullshit ain't nothin'

I'm back again
Jesus on that cross, I had to rise again
Time to get my blessings, time to get my blessings
I had to live my life, I had to learn my lessons
I had to keep that smile but deep inside I'm stressing
Just tryna keep my spirits from that deep depression
It's time to tighten up
I put my pride down and pick that Bible up
Looking in the mirror tryna find myself
Queen, she know I love her till it life or death
Living on the edge plotting on the plans
Nothing without God, nothing without my fans
Sorry for my absence, hope y'all understand
No more We The Best, but Khaled still my man
Critics want the beef but I'm not feeding them
My loyalty don't stop if we don't speak again
I could cry tears right now
Don't know how I feel right now
All that meditation that I did, all that beasting in the gym
All this energy inside I got to give
Back and I'm better than y'all, ready whenever the call
They expecting me to fold, friends turn into ya' foes
Kept focus on the goals, mind, body and the soul
New me, it's a new day, that's another story untold

Feeling so immortal I must rise again
Put that on my mama, put that on my kids
R.I.P. Fo' Fifth, I tat that on my skin
You just be my angel till we meet again
I can hear you nod like ""just keep going in""
I'm feeling the ether, I'm feeling Aretha
I keep it realer than people ain't no lies comin' out of the speakers
I gotta watch for the leechers, false prophets and the evil preachers
Come with normal features, I'm that different kind of a creature
I'm a fucking soldier, all my trials done made me stronger
Passion, I can't control it, hating, I can't condone it
Something just gotta give, don't listen, you gotta feel
Part of me had to die so one part of me gets to live
Walking out on the label I put aside all the fears
I'ma show all you niggas I do this shit here for real
On God

If I give you all of me, would I get all of you?
If I told you I'm anointed, could you see the proof?
Give my heart and soul for you when I'm inside the booth
Feel my love, feel my pain when I'm inside the booth
Would you switch or change on me if you knew the truth?
No, I ain't the same person that was introduced
Thank the Lord 'cause I don't look like what I been through"

eco skinny,Weekend,rap,"To start with, look at all the books. There were her Edith Wharton novels, arranged not by title but date of publication; there was the complete Modern Library set of Henry James, a gift from her father on her twenty-first birthday; there were the dog-eared paperbacks assigned in her college courses, a lot of Dickens, a smidgen of Trollope, along with good helpings of Austen, George Eliot, and the redoubtable Brontë sisters.

There were a whole lot of black-and-white New Directions paperbacks, mostly poetry by people like H.D. or Denise Levertov.There were the Colette novels she read on the sly.

There was the first edition of Couples, belonging to her mother, which Madeleine had surreptitiously dipped into back in sixth grade and which she was using now to provide textual support in her English honors thesis on the marriage plot.

There was, in short, this mid-size but still portable library representing pretty much everything Madeleine had read in college, a collection of texts, seemingly chosen at random, whose focus slowly narrowed, like a personality test, a sophisticated one you couldn’t trick by anticipating the implications of its questions and finally got so lost in that your only recourse was to answer the simple truth.

And then you waited for the result, hoping for “Artistic,” or “Passionate,” thinking you could live with “Sensitive,” secretly fearing “Narcissistic” and “Domestic,” but finally being presented with an outcome that cut both ways and made you feel different depending on the day, the hour, or the guy you happened to be dating: “Incurably Romantic.”

These were the books in the room where Madeleine lay, with a pillow over her head, on the morning of her college graduation. She’d read each and every one, often multiple times, frequently underlining passages, but that was no help to her now.

Madeleine was trying to ignore the room and everything in it. She was hoping to drift back down into the oblivion where she’d been safely couched for the last three hours.

Any higher level of wakefulness would force her to come to grips with certain disagreeable facts: for instance, the amount and variety of the alcohol she’d imbibed last night, and the fact that she’d gone to sleep with her contacts in.

Thinking about such specifics would, in turn, call to mind the reasons she’d drunk so much in the first place, which she definitely didn’t want to do. And so Madeleine adjusted her pillow, blocking out the early morning light, and tried to fall back to sleep.

But it was useless. Because right then, at the other end of her apartment, the doorbell began to ring.

Early June, Providence, Rhode Island, the sun up for almost two hours already, lighting up the pale bay and the smokestacks of the Narragansett Electric factory, rising like the sun on the Brown University seal emblazoned on all the pennants and banners draped up over campus, a sun with a sagacious face, representing knowledge.

But this sun—the one over Providence—was doing the metaphorical sun one better, because the founders of the university, in their Baptist pessimism, had chosen to depict the light of knowledge enshrouded by clouds, indicating that ignorance had not yet been dispelled from the human realm, whereas the actual sun was just now fighting its way through cloud cover, sending down splintered beams of light and giving hope to the squadrons of parents, who’d been soaked and frozen all weekend, that the unseasonable weather might not ruin the day’s festivities.

All over College Hill, in the geometric gardens of the Georgian mansions, the magnolia-scented front yards of Victorians, along brick sidewalks running past black iron fences like those in a Charles Addams cartoon or a Lovecraft story; outside the art studios at the Rhode Island School of Design, where one painting major, having stayed up all night to work, was blaring Patti Smith; shining off the instruments (tuba and trumpet, respectively) of the two members of the Brown marching band who had arrived early at the meeting point and were nervously looking around, wondering where everyone else was; brightening the cobblestone side streets that led downhill to the polluted river, the sun was shining on every brass doorknob, insect wing, and blade of grass.
And, in concert with the suddenly flooding light, like a starting gun for all the activity, the doorbell in Madeleine’s fourth-floor apartment began, clamorously, insistently, to ring.

The pulse reached her less as a sound than as a sensation, an electric shock shooting up her spine. In one motion Madeleine tore the pillow off her head and sat up in bed. She knew who was ringing the buzzer.

It was her parents. She’d agreed to meet Alton and Phyllida for breakfast at 7:30. She’d made this plan with them two months ago, in April, and now here they were, at the appointed time, in their eager, dependable way.

That Alton and Phyllida had driven up from New Jersey to see her graduate, that what they were here to celebrate today wasn’t only her achievement but their own as parents, had nothing wrong or unexpected about it.

The problem was that Madeleine, for the first time in her life, wanted no part of it. She wasn’t proud of herself. She was in no mood to celebrate. She’d lost faith in the significance of the day and what the day represented.

She considered not answering. But she knew that if she didn’t answer, one of her roommates would, and then she’d have to explain where she’d disappeared to last night, and with whom. Therefore, Madeleine slid out of the bed and reluctantly stood up.

This seemed to go well for a moment, standing up. Her head felt curiously light, as if hollowed out. But then the blood, draining from her skull like sand from an hourglass, hit a bottleneck, and the back of her head exploded in pain.

In the midst of this barrage, like the furious core from which it emanated, the buzzer erupted again.

She came out of her bedroom and stumbled in bare feet to the intercom in the hall, slapping the SPEAK button to silence the buzzer.

“Hello?”

“What’s the matter? Didn’t you hear the bell?” It was Alton’s voice, as deep and commanding as ever, despite the fact that it was issuing from a tiny speaker.

“Sorry,” Madeleine said. “I was in the shower.”

“Likely story. Will you let us in, please?”
Madeleine didn’t want to. She needed to wash up first.

“I’m coming down,” she said.

This time, she held down the SPEAK button too long, cutting off Alton’s response. She pressed it again and said, “Daddy?” but while she was speaking, Alton must have been speaking, too, because when she pressed LISTEN all that came through was static.

Madeleine took this pause in communications to lean her forehead against the door frame. The wood felt nice and cool.

The thought struck her that, if she could keep her face pressed against the soothing wood, she might be able to cure her headache, and if she could keep her forehead pressed against the door frame for the rest of the day, while somehow still being able to leave the apartment, she might make it through breakfast with her parents, march in the commencement procession, get a diploma, and graduate.

She lifted her face and pressed speak again.

“Daddy?”

But it was Phyllida’s voice that answered. “Maddy? What’s the matter? Let us in.”

“My roommates are still asleep. I’m coming down. Don’t ring the bell anymore.”

“We want to see your apartment!”

“Not now. I’m coming down. Don’t ring.”

She took her hand from the buttons and stood back, glaring at the intercom as if daring it to make a sound. When it didn’t, she started back down the hall. She was halfway to the bathroom when her roommate Abby emerged, blocking the way.

She yawned, running a hand through her big hair, and then, noticing Madeleine, smiled knowingly.
“So,” Abby said, “where did you sneak off to last night?”

“My parents are here,” Madeleine said. “I have to go to breakfast.”

“Come on. Tell me.”

“There’s nothing to tell. I’m late.”

“How come you’re wearing the same clothes, then?”

Instead of replying, Madeleine looked down at herself. Ten hours earlier, when she’d borrowed the black Betsey Johnson dress from Olivia, Madeleine had thought it looked good on her. But now the dress felt hot and sticky, the fat leather belt looked like an S&M restraint, and there was a stain near the hem that she didn’t want to identify.

Abby, meanwhile, had knocked on Olivia’s door and entered. “So much for Maddy’s broken heart,” she said. “Wake up! You’ve got to see this.”

The path to the bathroom was clear. Madeleine’s need for a shower was extreme, almost medical. At a minimum, she had to brush her teeth.

But Olivia’s voice was audible now. Soon Madeleine would have two roommates interrogating her. Her parents were liable to start ringing again any minute. As quietly as possible, she inched back down the hall.

She stepped into a pair of loafers left by the front door, crushing the heels flat as she caught her balance, and escaped into the outer corridor.

The elevator was waiting at the end of the floral runner. Waiting, Madeleine realized, because she’d failed to close the sliding gate when she’d staggered out of the thing a few hours earlier.

Now she shut the gate securely and pressed the button for the lobby, and with a jolt the antique contraption began to descend through the building’s interior gloom.

Madeleine’s building, a Neo-Romanesque castle called the Narragansett that wrapped around the plunging corner of Benefit Street and Church Street, had been built at the turn of the century.

Among its surviving period details—the stained-glass skylight, the brass wall sconces, the marble lobby—was the elevator. Made of curving metal bars like a giant birdcage, the elevator miraculously still functioned, but it moved slowly, and as the car dropped, Madeleine took the opportunity to make herself more presentable.

She ran her hands through her hair, finger-combing it. She polished her front teeth with her index finger. She rubbed mascara crumbs from her eyes and moistened her lips with her tongue. Finally, passing the balustrade on the second floor, she checked her reflection in the small mirror attached to the rear panel.

One of the nice things about being twenty-two, or about being Madeleine Hanna, was that three weeks of romantic anguish, followed by a night of epic drinking, didn’t do much visible damage. Except for puffiness around her eyes, Madeleine looked like the same pretty, dark-haired person as usual.

The symmetries of her face—the straight nose, the Katharine Hepburn–ish cheekbones and jawline—were almost mathematical in their precision. Only the slight furrow in her brow gave evidence of the slightly anxious person that Madeleine felt herself, intrinsically, to be.

She could see her parents waiting below. They were trapped between the lobby door and the door to the street, Alton in a seersucker jacket,

Phyllida in a navy suit and matching gold-buckled purse. For a second, Madeleine had an impulse to stop the elevator and leave her parents stuck in the foyer amid all the college-town clutter—the posters for New Wave bands with names like Wretched Misery or the Clits, the pornographic Egon Schiele drawings by the RISD kid on the second floor, all the clamorous Xeroxes whose subtext conveyed the message that the wholesome, patriotic values of her parents’ generation were now on the ash heap of history, replaced by a nihilistic, post-punk sensibility that Madeleine herself didn’t understand but was perfectly happy to scandalize her parents by pretending that she did—before the elevator stopped in the lobby and she slid open the gate and stepped out to meet them.

Alton was first through the door. “Here she is!” he said avidly. “The college graduate!” In his net-charging way, he surged forward to seize her in a hug. Madeleine stiffened, worried that she smelled of alcohol or, worse, of sex.

“I don’t know why you wouldn’t let us see your apartment,” Phyllida said, coming up next. “I was looking forward to meeting Abby and Olivia. We’d love to treat them to dinner later.”

“We’re not staying for dinner,” Alton reminded her.

“Well, we might. That depends on Maddy’s schedule.”

“No, that’s not the plan. The plan is to see Maddy for breakfast and then leave after the ceremony.”

“Your father and his plans,” Phyllida said to Madeleine. “Are you wearing that dress to the ceremony?”

“I don’t know,” Madeleine said.

“I can’t get used to these shoulder pads all the young women are wearing. They’re so mannish.”

“It’s Olivia’s.”

“You look pretty whacked out, Mad,” Alton said. “Big party last night?”

“Not really.”

“Don’t you have anything of your own to wear?” Phyllida said.

“I’ll have my robe on, Mummy,” Madeleine said, and, to forestall further inspection, headed past them through the foyer.

Outside, the sun had lost its battle with the clouds and vanished. The weather looked not much better than it had all weekend. Campus Dance, on Friday night, had been more or less rained out. The Baccalaureate service on Sunday had proceeded under a steady drizzle.

Now, on Monday, the rain had stopped, but the temperature felt closer to St. Patrick’s than to Memorial Day.

As she waited for her parents to join her on the sidewalk, it occurred to Madeleine that she hadn’t had sex, not really. This was some consolation.

“Your sister sends her regrets,” Phyllida said, coming out.

“She has to take Richard the Lionhearted for an ultrasound today.”

Richard the Lionhearted was Madeleine’s nine-week-old nephew. Everyone else called him Richard.

“What’s the matter with him?” Madeleine asked.

“One of his kidneys is petite, apparently. The doctors want to keep an eye on it. If you ask me, all these ultrasounds do is find things to worry about.”

“Speaking of ultrasounds,” Alton said, “I need to get one on my knee.”

Phyllida paid no attention. “Anyway, Allie’s devastated not to see you graduate. As is Blake. But they’re hoping you and your new beau might visit them this summer, on your way to the Cape.”

You had to stay alert around Phyllida. Here she was, ostensibly talking about Richard the Lionhearted’s petite kidney, and already she’d managed to move the subject to Madeleine’s new boyfriend, Leonard (whom Phyllida and Alton hadn’t met), and to Cape Cod (where Madeleine had announced plans to cohabitate with him). On a normal day, when her brain was working, Madeleine would have been able to keep one step ahead of Phyllida, but this morning the best she could manage was to let the words float past her.

Fortunately, Alton changed the subject. “So, where do you recommend for breakfast?”

Madeleine turned and looked vaguely down Benefit Street. “There’s a place this way.”

She started shuffling along the sidewalk. Walking—moving—seemed like a good idea. She led them past a line of quaint, nicely maintained houses bearing historical placards, and a big apartment building with a gable roof. Providence was a corrupt town, crime-ridden and mob-controlled, but up on College Hill this was hard to see.

The sketchy downtown and dying or dead textile mills lay below, in the grim distance. Here the narrow streets, many of them cobblestone, climbed past mansions or snaked around Puritan graveyards full of headstones as narrow as heaven’s door, streets with names like Prospect, Benevolent, Hope, and Meeting, all of them feeding into the arboreous campus at the top.

The sheer physical elevation suggested an intellectual one.

“Aren’t these slate sidewalks lovely,” Phyllida said as she followed along.

“We used to have slate sidewalks on our street.

They’re much more attractive. But then the borough replaced them with concrete.”

“Assessed us for the bill, too,”

Alton said. He was limping slightly, bringing up the rear. The right leg of his charcoal trousers was swelled from the knee brace he wore on and off the tennis court. Alton had been club champion in his age group for twelve years running, one of those older guys with a sweatband ringing a balding crown, a choppy forehand, and absolute murder in his eyes.

Madeleine had been trying to beat Alton her entire life without success. This was even more infuriating because she was better than he was, at this point. But whenever she took a set from Alton he started intimidating her, acting mean, disputing calls, and her game fell apart.

Madeleine was worried that there was something paradigmatic in this, that she was destined to go through life being cowed by less capable men.

As a result, Madeleine’s tennis matches against Alton had assumed such outsize personal significance for her that she got tight whenever she played him, with predictable results.

And Alton still gloated when he won, still got all rosy and jiggly, as if he’d bested her by sheer talent.

At the corner of Benefit and Waterman, they crossed behind the white steeple of First Baptist Church. In preparation for the ceremony, loudspeakers had been set up on the lawn.

A man wearing a bow tie, a dean-of-students-looking person, was tensely smoking a cigarette and inspecting a raft of balloons tied to the churchyard fence.

By now Phyllida had caught up to Madeleine, taking her arm to negotiate the uneven slate, which was pushed up by the roots of gnarled plane trees that lined the curb. As a little girl, Madeleine had thought her mother pretty, but that was a long time ago. Phyllida’s face had gotten heavier over the years; her cheeks were beginning to sag like those of a camel. The conservative clothes she wore—the clothes of a philanthropist or lady ambassador—had a tendency to conceal her figure. Phyllida’s hair was where her power resided. It was expensively set into a smooth dome, like a band shell for the presentation of that long-running act, her face. For as long as Madeleine could remember, Phyllida had never been at a loss for words or shy about a point of etiquette. Among her friends Madeleine liked to make fun of her mother’s formality, but she often found herself comparing other people’s manners unfavorably with Phyllida’s.

And right now Phyllida was looking at Madeleine with the proper expression for this moment: thrilled by the pomp and ceremony, eager to put intelligent questions to any of Madeleine’s professors she happened to meet, or to trade pleasantries with fellow parents of graduating seniors.

In short, she was available to everyone and everything and in step with the social and academic pageantry, all of which exacerbated Madeleine’s feeling of being out of step, for this day and the rest of her life.

She plunged on, however, across Waterman Street, and up the steps of Carr House, seeking refuge and coffee.

The café had just opened. The guy behind the counter, who was wearing Elvis Costello glasses, was rinsing out the espresso machine.

At a table against the wall, a girl with stiff pink hair was smoking a clove cigarette and reading Invisible Cities. “Tainted Love” played from the stereo on top of the refrigerator.

Phyllida, holding her handbag protectively against her chest, had paused to peruse the student art on the walls: six paintings of small, skin-diseased dogs wearing bleach-bottle collars.

“Isn’t this fun?” she said tolerantly.

“La Bohème,” Alton said.

Madeleine installed her parents at a table near the bay window, as far away from the pink-haired girl as possible, and went up to the counter. The guy took his time coming over. She ordered three coffees—a large for her—and bagels. While the bagels were being toasted, she brought the coffees over to her parents.

Alton, who couldn’t sit at the breakfast table without reading, had taken a discarded Village Voice from a nearby table and was perusing it. Phyllida was staring overtly at the girl with pink hair.

“Do you think that’s comfortable?” she inquired in a low voice.

Madeleine turned to see that the girl’s ragged black jeans were held together by a few hundred safety pins.

“I don’t know, Mummy. Why don’t you go ask her?”

“I’m afraid of getting poked.”

“According to this article,” Alton said, reading the Voice, “homosexuality didn’t exist until the nineteenth century. It was invented. In Germany.”

The coffee was hot, and lifesavingly good. Sipping it, Madeleine began to feel slightly less awful.

After a few minutes, she went up to get the bagels.

They were a little burned, but she didn’t want to wait for new ones, and so brought them back to the table. After examining his with a sour expression, Alton began scraping it punitively with a plastic knife.

Phyllida asked, “So, are we going to meet Leonard today?”

“I’m not sure,” Madeleine said.

“Anything you want us to know about?”

“No.”

“Are you two still planning to live together this summer?”

By this time Madeleine had taken a bite of her bagel. And since the answer to her mother’s question was complicated—strictly speaking, Madeleine and Leonard weren’t planning on living together, because they’d broken up three weeks ago; despite this fact, however, Madeleine hadn’t given up hope of a reconciliation, and seeing as she’d spent so much effort getting her parents used to the idea of her living with a guy, and didn’t want to jeopardize that by admitting that the plan was off—she was relieved to be able to point at her full mouth, which prevented her from replying.

“Well, you’re an adult now,” Phyllida said. “You can do what you like. Though, for the record, I have to say that I don’t approve.”

“You’ve already gone on record about that,” Alton broke in.

“Because it’s still a bad idea!” Phyllida cried. “I don’t mean the propriety of it. I’m talking about the practical problems.

If you move in with Leonard—or any young man—and he’s the one with the job, then you begin at a disadvantage.

What happens if you two don’t get along? Where are you then? You won’t have any place to live. Or anything to do.”

That her mother was correct in her analysis, that the predicament Phyllida warned Madeleine about was exactly the predicament she was already in, didn’t motivate Madeleine to register agreement.

“You quit your job when you met me,” Alton said to Phyllida.

“That’s why I know what I’m talking about.”

“Can we change the subject?” Madeleine said at last, having swallowed her food.

“Of course we can, sweetheart. That’s the last I’ll say about it. If your plans change, you can always come home. Your father and I would love to have you.”

“Not me,” Alton said. “I don’t want her. Moving back home is always a bad idea. Stay away.”

“Don’t worry,” Madeleine said. “I will.”

“The choice is yours,” Phyllida said. “But if you do come home, you could have the loft. That way you can come and go as you like.”

To her surprise, Madeleine found herself contemplating this proposal.

Why not tell her parents everything, curl up in the backseat of the car, and let them take her home? She could move into her old bedroom, with the sleigh bed and the Madeline wallpaper.

She could become a spinster, like Emily Dickinson, writing poems full of dashes and brilliance, and never gaining weight.

Phyllida brought her out of this reverie.

“Maddy?” she said. “Isn’t that your friend Mitchell?”

Madeleine wheeled in her seat. “Where?”

“I think that’s Mitchell. Across the street.”

In the churchyard, sitting Indian-style in the freshly mown grass, Madeleine’s “friend” Mitchell Grammaticus was indeed there. His lips were moving, as if he was talking to himself.

“Why don’t you invite him to join us?” Phyllida said.

“Now?”

“Why not? I’d love to see Mitchell.”

“He’s probably waiting for his parents,” Madeleine said.

Phyllida waved, despite the fact that Mitchell was too far away to notice.

“What’s he doing sitting on the ground?” Alton asked.

The three Hannas stared across the street at Mitchell in his half-lotus.

“Well, if you’re not going to ask him, I will,” Phyllida finally said.

“O.K.,” Madeleine said. “Fine. I’ll go ask him.”

The day was getting warmer, but not by much. Black clouds were massing in the distance as Madeleine came down the steps of Carr House and crossed the street into the churchyard.

Someone inside the church was testing the loudspeakers, fussily repeating, “Sussex, Essex, and Kent. Sussex, Essex, and Kent.” A banner draped over the church entrance read “Class of 1982.” Beneath the banner, in the grass, was Mitchell.

His lips were still moving silently, but when he noticed Madeleine approaching they abruptly stopped.

Madeleine remained a few feet away.

“My parents are here,” she informed him.

“It’s graduation,” Mitchell replied evenly. “Everyone’s parents are here.”

“They want to say hello to you.”

At this Mitchell smiled faintly. “They probably don’t realize you’re not speaking to me.”

“No, they don’t,” Madeleine said. “And, anyway, I am. Now. Speaking to you.”

“Under duress or as a change of policy?”

Madeleine shifted her weight, wrinkling her face unhappily. “Look. I’m really hungover. I barely slept last night. My parents have been here about ten minutes and they’re already driving me crazy. So if you could just come over and say hello, that would be great.”

Mitchell’s large emotional eyes blinked twice. He was wearing a vintage gabardine shirt, dark wool pants, and beat-up wingtips. Madeleine had never seen him in shorts or tennis shoes.

“I’m sorry,” he said. “About what happened.”

“Fine,” Madeleine said, looking away. “It doesn’t matter.”

“I was just being my usual vile self.”

“So was I.”

They were quiet a moment. Madeleine felt Mitchell’s eyes on her, and she crossed her arms over her chest.

What had happened was this: one night the previous December, in a state of anxiety about her romantic life, Madeleine had run into Mitchell on campus and brought him back to her apartment.

She’d needed male attention and had flirted with him, without entirely admitting it to herself. In her bedroom, Mitchell had picked up a jar of deep-heating gel on her desk, asking what it was for.

Madeleine had explained that people who were athletic sometimes got sore muscles. She understood that Mitchell might not have experienced this phenomenon, seeing as all he did was sit in the library, but he should take her word for it.

At that point, Mitchell had come up behind her and wiped a gob of heating gel behind her ear. Madeleine jumped up, shouting at Mitchell, and wiped the gunk off with a T-shirt. Though she was within her rights to be angry,

Madeleine also knew (even at the time) that she was using the incident as a pretext for getting Mitchell out of her bedroom and for covering up the fact that she’d been flirting with him in the first place.

The worst part of the incident was how stricken Mitchell had looked, as if he’d been about to cry. He kept saying he was sorry, he was just joking around, but she ordered him to leave.

In the following days, replaying the incident in her mind, Madeleine had felt worse and worse about it. She’d been on the verge of calling Mitchell to apologize when she’d received a letter from him, a highly detailed, cogently argued, psychologically astute, quietly hostile four-page letter, in which he called her a “cocktease” and claimed that her behavior that night had been “the erotic equivalent of bread and circus, with just the circus.”

The next time they’d run into each other, Madeleine had acted as if she didn’t know him, and they hadn’t spoken since.

Now, in the churchyard of First Baptist, Mitchell looked up at her and said, “O.K. Let’s go say hello to your parents.”

Phyllida was waving as they came up the steps. In the flirtatious voice she reserved for her favorite of Madeleine’s friends, she called out, “I thought that was you on the ground. You looked like a swami!”

“Congratulations, Mitchell!” Alton said, heartily shaking Mitchell’s hand. “Big day today. One of the milestones. A new generation takes the reins.”

They invited Mitchell to sit down and asked him if he wanted anything to eat. Madeleine went back to the counter to get more coffee, glad to have Mitchell keeping her parents occupied. As she watched him, in his old man’s clothes, engaging Alton and Phyllida in conversation, Madeleine thought to herself, as she’d thought many times before, that Mitchell was the kind of smart, sane, parent-pleasing boy she should fall in love with and marry. That she would never fall in love with Mitchell and marry him, precisely because of this eligibility, was yet another indication, in a morning teeming with them, of just how screwed up she was in matters of the heart.

When she returned to the table, no one acknowledged her.

“So, Mitchell,” Phyllida was asking, “what are your plans after graduation?”

“My father’s been asking me the same question,” Mitchell answered. “For some reason he thinks Religious Studies isn’t a marketable degree.”

Madeleine smiled for the first time all day. “See? Mitchell doesn’t have a job lined up, either.”

“Well, I sort of do,” Mitchell said.

“You do not,” Madeleine challenged him.

“I’m serious. I do.” He explained that he and his roommate, Larry Pleshette, had come up with a plan to fight the recession. As liberal-arts degree holders matriculating into the job market at a time when unemployment was at 9.5 percent, they had decided, after much consideration, to leave the country and stay away as long as possible.

At the end of the summer, after they’d saved up enough money, they were going to backpack through Europe. After they’d seen everything in Europe there was to see, they were going to fly to India and stay there as long as their money held out. The whole trip would take eight or nine months, maybe as long as a year.

“You’re going to India?” Madeleine said. “That’s not a job.”

“We’re going to be research assistants,” Mitchell said. “For Prof. Hughes.”

“Prof. Hughes in the theater department?”

“I saw a program about India recently,” Phyllida said. “It was terribly depressing. The poverty!”

“That’s a plus for me, Mrs. Hanna,” Mitchell said. “I thrive in squalor.”

Phyllida, who couldn’t resist this sort of mischief, gave up her solemnity, rippling with amusement. “Then you’re going to the right place!”

“Maybe I’ll take a trip, too,” Madeleine said in a threatening tone.

No one reacted. Instead Alton asked Mitchell, “What sort of immunizations do you need for India?”

“Cholera and typhus. Gamma globulin’s optional.”

Phyllida shook her head. “Your mother must be worried sick.”

“When I was in the service,” Alton said, “they shot us up with a million things. Didn’t even tell us what the shots were for.”

“I think I’ll move to Paris,” Madeleine said in a louder voice. “Instead of getting a job.”

“Mitchell,” Phyllida continued, “with your interest in religious studies, I’d think India would be a perfect fit. They’ve got everything. Hindus, Muslims, Sikhs, Zoroastrians, Jains, Buddhists.

It’s like Baskin and Robbins! I’ve always been fascinated by religion. Unlike my doubting-Thomas husband.”

Alton winked. “I doubt that doubting Thomas existed.”

“Do you know Paul Moore, Bishop Moore, at the Cathedral of Saint John the Divine?”

Phyllida said, keeping Mitchell’s attention.

“He’s a great friend. You might find it interesting to meet him. We’d be happy to introduce you. When we’re in the city, I always go to services at the cathedral. Have you ever been there? Oh. Well. How can I describe it? It’s simply—well, simply divine!”

Phyllida held a hand to her throat with the pleasure of this bon mot, while Mitchell obligingly, even convincingly, laughed.

“Speaking of religious dignitaries,”

Alton cut in, “did I ever tell you about the time we met the Dalai Lama?

It was at this fund-raiser at the Waldorf. We were in the receiving line. Must have been three hundred people at least. Anyway, when we finally got up to the Dalai Lama, I asked him,

‘Are you any relation to Dolly Parton?’”

“I was mortified!” Phyllida cried. “Absolutely mortified.”

“Daddy,” Madeleine said, “you’re going to be late.”

“What?”

“You should get going if you want to get a good spot.”

Alton looked at his watch. “We’ve still got an hour.”

“It gets really crowded,” Madeleine emphasized. “You should go now.”

Alton and Phyllida looked at Mitchell, as if they trusted him to advise them. Under the table, Madeleine kicked him, and he alertly responded, “It does get pretty crowded.”

“Where’s the best place to stand?” Alton asked, again addressing Mitchell.

“By the Van Wickle Gates. At the top of College Street. That’s where we’ll come through.”

Alton stood up from the table. After shaking Mitchell’s hand, he bent to kiss Madeleine on the cheek.

“We’ll see you later. Miss Baccalaureate, 1982.”

“Congratulations, Mitchell,” Phyllida said. “So nice to see you.

And remember, when you’re on your Grand Tour, be sure to send your mother loads of letters. Otherwise, she’ll be frantic.”

To Madeleine, she said, “You might change that dress before the march. It has a visible stain.”

With that, Alton and Phyllida, in their glaring parental actuality, all seersucker and handbag, cuff links and pearls, crossed the beige-and-brick space of Carr House and went out the door.

As though to signal their departure, a new song came on: Joe Jackson’s high-pitched voice swooping above a synthesized drumbeat. The guy behind the counter cranked up the volume.

Madeleine laid her head on the table, her hair covering her face.

“I’m never drinking again,” she said.

“Famous last words.”

“You have no idea what’s been going on with me.”

“How could I? You haven’t been speaking to me.”

Without lifting her cheek from the table, Madeleine said in a pitiful voice, “I’m homeless. I’m graduating from college and I’m a homeless person.”

“Yeah, sure.”

“I am!” Madeleine insisted. “First I was supposed to move to New York with Abby and Olivia. Then it looked like I was moving to the Cape, though, so I told them to get another roommate. And now I’m not moving to the Cape and I have nowhere to go. My mother wants me to move back home but I’d rather kill myself.”

“I’m moving back home for the summer,”

Mitchell said. “To Detroit. At least you’re near New York.”

“I haven’t heard back from grad school yet and it’s June,” Madeleine continued.

“I was supposed to find out over a month ago! I could call the admissions department, but I don’t because I’m scared to find out that I’ve been rejected. As long as I don’t know, I still have hope.”

There was a moment before Mitchell spoke again. “You can come to India with me,” he said.

Madeleine opened one eye to see, through a whorl in her hair, that Mitchell wasn’t entirely joking.

“It’s not even about grad school,” she said. Taking a deep breath, she confessed, “Leonard and I broke up.”

It felt deeply pleasurable to say this, to name her sadness, and so Madeleine was surprised by the coldness of Mitchell’s reply.

“Why are you telling me this?” he said.

She lifted her head, brushing her hair out of her face. “I don’t know. You wanted to know what was the matter.”

“I didn’t, actually. I didn’t even ask.”

“I thought you might care,” Madeleine said. “Since you’re my friend.”

“Right,” Mitchell said, his voice suddenly sarcastic.

“Our wonderful friendship! Our ‘friendship’ isn’t a real friendship because it only works on your terms.

You set the rules, Madeleine. If you decide you don’t want to talk to me for three months, we don’t talk. Then you decide you do want to talk to me because you need me to entertain your parents—and now we’re talking again. We’re friends when you want to be friends, and we’re never more than friends because you don’t want to be. And I have to go along with that.”

“I’m sorry,” Madeleine said, feeling put-upon and blindsided. “I just don’t like you that way.”

“Exactly!” Mitchell cried. “You’re not attracted to me physically. O.K., fine. But who says I was ever attracted to you mentally?”

Madeleine reacted as if she’d been slapped. She was outraged, hurt, and defiant all at once.

“You’re such a”—she tried to think of the worst thing to say—“you’re such a jerk!”

She was hoping to remain imperious, but her chest was stinging, and, to her dismay, she burst into tears.

Mitchell reached out to touch her arm, but Madeleine shook him off. Getting to her feet, trying not to look like someone angrily weeping, she went out the door and down the steps onto Waterman Street.

Confronted by the festive churchyard, she turned downhill toward the river. She wanted to get away from campus. Her headache had returned, her temples were throbbing, and as she looked up at the storm clouds massing over downtown like more bad things to come, she asked herself why everyone was being so mean to her.



Madeleine’s love troubles had begun at a time when the French theory she was reading deconstructed the very notion of love. Semiotics 211 was an upper-level seminar taught by a former English department renegade.

Michael Zipperstein had come to Brown thirty-two years earlier as a New Critic. He’d inculcated the habits of close reading and biography-free interpretation into three generations of students before taking a Road to Damascus sabbatical, in Paris, in 1975, where he’d met Roland Barthes at a dinner party and been converted, over cassoulet, to the new faith.

Now Zipperstein taught two courses in the newly created Program in Semiotics Studies: Introduction to Semiotic Theory in the fall and, in the spring, Semiotics 211. Hygienically bald, with a seaman’s mustacheless white beard, Zipperstein favored French fisherman’s sweaters and wide-wale corduroys. He buried people with his reading lists: in addition to all the semiotic big hitters—Derrida, Eco, Barthes—the students in Semiotics 211 had to contend with a magpie nest of reserve reading that included everything from Balzac’s Sarrasine to issues of Semiotext(e) to photocopied selections from E. M. Cioran, Robert Walser, Claude Levi-Strauss, Peter Handke, and Carl Van Vechten.

To get into the seminar, you had to submit to a one-on-one interview with Zipperstein during which he asked bland personal questions, such as what your favorite food or dog breed was, and made enigmatic Warholian remarks in response. This esoteric probing, along with Zipperstein’s guru’s dome and beard, gave his students a sense that they’d been spiritually vetted and were now—for two hours on Thursday afternoons, at least—part of a campus lit-crit elite.

Which was exactly what Madeleine wanted. She’d become an English major for the purest and dullest of reasons: because she loved to read.

The university’s “British and American Literature Course Catalog” was, for Madeleine, what its Bergdorf equivalent was for her roommates.

A course listing like “English 274: Lyly’s Euphues” excited Madeleine the way a pair of Fiorucci cowboy boots did Abby. “English 450A:

Hawthorne and James” filled Madeleine with an expectation of sinful hours in bed not unlike what Olivia got from wearing a Lycra skirt and leather blazer to Danceteria. Even as a girl in their house in Prettybrook, Madeleine wandered into the library, with its shelves of books rising higher than she could reach—newly purchased volumes such as Love Story or Myra Breckinridgethat exuded a faintly forbidden air, as well as venerable leather-bound editions of Fielding,

Thackeray, and Dickens—and the magisterial presence of all those potentially readable words stopped her in her tracks. She could scan book spines for as long as an hour. Her cataloging of the family’s holdings rivaled the Dewey decimal system in its comprehensiveness.

Madeleine knew right where everything was. The shelves near the fireplace held Alton’s favorites, biographies of American presidents and British prime ministers, memoirs by warmongering secretaries of state, novels about sailing or espionage by William F. Buckley, Jr. Phyllida’s books filled the left side of the bookcases leading up to the parlor, NYRB-reviewed novels and essay collections, as well as coffee-table volumes about English gardens or chinoiserie.

Even now, at bed-and-breakfasts or seaside hotels, a shelf full of forlorn books always cried out to Madeleine. She ran her fingers over their salt-spotted covers. She peeled apart pages made tacky by ocean air. She had no sympathy for paperback thrillers and detective stories.

It was the abandoned hardback, the jacketless 1931 Dial Press edition ringed with many a coffee cup, that pierced Madeleine’s heart. Her friends might be calling her name on the beach, the clambake already under way, but Madeleine would sit down on the bed and read for a little while to make the sad old book feel better. She had read Longfellow’s “Hiawatha” that way. She’d read James Fenimore Cooper. She’d read H. M. Pulham, Esquire by John P. Marquand.

And yet sometimes she worried about what those musty old books were doing to her. Some people majored in English to prepare for law school. Others became journalists. The smartest guy in the honors program, Adam Vogel, a child of academics, was planning on getting a Ph.D. and becoming an academic himself.

That left a large contingent of people majoring in English by default. Because they weren’t left-brained enough for science, because history was too dry, philosophy too difficult, geology too petroleum-oriented, and math too mathematical—because they weren’t musical, artistic, financially motivated, or really all that smart, these people were pursuing university degrees doing something no different from what they’d done in first grade: reading stories.

English was what people who didn’t know what to major in majored in.

Her junior year, Madeleine had taken an honors seminar called The Marriage Plot: Selected Novels of Austen, Eliot, and James.

The class was taught by K. McCall Saunders. Saunders was a seventy-nine-year-old New Englander. He had a long, horsey face and a moist laugh that exposed his gaudy dental work. His pedagogical method consisted of his reading aloud lectures he’d written twenty or thirty years earlier.

Madeleine stayed in the class because she felt sorry for Professor Saunders and because the reading list was so good. In Saunders’s opinion, the novel had reached its apogee with the marriage plot and had never recovered from its disappearance. In the days when success in life had depended on marriage, and marriage had depended on money, novelists had had a subject to write about. The great epics sang of war, the novel of marriage.

Sexual equality, good for women, had been bad for the novel. And divorce had undone it completely.

What would it matter whom Emma married if she could file for separation later?

How would Isabel Archer’s marriage to Gilbert Osmond have been affected by the existence of a prenup?

As far as Saunders was concerned, marriage didn’t mean much anymore, and neither did the novel. Where could you find the marriage plot nowadays? You couldn’t. You had to read historical fiction. You had to read non-Western novels involving traditional societies. Afghani novels, Indian novels. You had to go, literarily speaking, back in time.

Madeleine’s final paper for the seminar was titled “The Interrogative Mood: Marriage Proposals and the (Strictly Limited) Sphere of the Feminine.”

It had impressed Saunders so much that he’d asked Madeleine to come see him. In his office, which had a grandparental smell, he expressed his opinion that Madeleine might expand her paper into a senior honors thesis, along with his willingness to serve as her advisor.

Madeleine smiled politely. Professor Saunders specialized in the periods she was interested in, the Regency leading into the Victorian era. He was sweet, and learned, and it was clear from his unsubscribed office hours that no one else wanted him as an advisor, and so Madeleine had said yes, she would love to work with him on her senior thesis.

She used a line from Trollope’s Barchester Towers as an epigraph:

“There is no happiness in love, except at the end of an English novel.”

Her plan was to begin with Jane Austen. After a brief examination of Pride and Prejudice, Persuasion, and Sense and Sensibility, all comedies, essentially, that ended with weddings, Madeleine was going to move on to the Victorian novel, where things got more complicated and considerably darker. Middlemarch and The Portrait of a Lady didn’t end with weddings.

They began with the traditional moves of the marriage plot—the suitors, the proposals, the misunderstandings—but after the wedding ceremony they kept on going. These novels followed their spirited, intelligent heroines, Dorothea Brooke and Isabel Archer, into their disappointing married lives, and it was here that the marriage plot reached its greatest artistic expression.

By 1900 the marriage plot was no more. Madeleine planned to end with a brief discussion of its demise.

In Sister Carrie, Dreiser had Carrie live adulterously with Drouet, marry Hurstwood in an invalid ceremony, and then run off to become an actress—and this was only in 1900! For a conclusion, Madeleine thought she might cite the wife-swapping in Updike.

That was the last vestige of the marriage plot: the persistence in calling it “wife-swapping” instead of “husband-swapping.” As if the woman were still a piece of property to be passed around.

Professor Saunders suggested that Madeleine look at historical sources. She’d obediently boned up on the rise of industrialism and the nuclear family, the formation of the middle class, and the Matrimonial Causes Act of 1857. But it wasn’t long before she’d become bored with the thesis. Doubts about the originality of her work nagged at her.

She felt as if she was regurgitating the arguments Saunders had made in his marriage plot seminar. Her meetings with the old professor were dispiriting, consisting of Saunders shuffling the pages she’d given him, pointing out various red marks he’d made in the margins.

Then one Sunday morning, before winter break, Abby’s boyfriend, Whitney, materialized at their kitchen table, reading something called Of Grammatology.

When Madeleine asked what the book was about, she was given to understand by Whitney that the idea of a book being “about” something was exactly what this book was against, and that, if it was “about” anything, then it was about the need to stop thinking of books as being about things.

Madeleine said she was going to make coffee. Whitney asked if she would make him some, too.

College wasn’t like the real world. In the real world people dropped names based on their renown.

In college, people dropped names based on their obscurity. Thus, in the weeks after this exchange with Whitney, Madeleine began hearing people saying “Derrida.” She heard them saying “Lyotard” and “Foucault” and “Deleuze” and “Baudrillard.”

That most of these people were those she instinctually disapproved of—upper-middle-class kids who wore Doc Martens and anarchist symbols—made Madeleine dubious about the value of their enthusiasm. But soon she noticed David Koppel, a smart and talented poet, also reading Derrida.

And Pookie Ames, who read slush for The Paris Review and whom Madeleine liked, was taking a course with Professor Zipperstein.

Madeleine had always been partial to grandiose professors, people like Sears Jayne who hammed it up in the classroom, reciting Hart Crane or

Anne Sexton in a gag voice. Whitney acted as though Professor Jayne was a joke. Madeleine didn’t agree. But after three solid years of taking literature courses, Madeleine had nothing like a firm critical methodology to apply to what she read.

Instead she had a fuzzy, unsystematic way of talking about books. It embarrassed her to hear the things people said in class. And the things she said. I felt that. It was interesting the way Proust. I liked the way Faulkner.

And when Olivia, who was tall and slim, with a long, aristocratic nose like a saluki, came in one day carrying Of Grammatology, Madeleine knew that what had been marginal was now mainstream.

“What’s that book like?”

“You haven’t read it?”

“Would I be asking if I had?”

Olivia sniffed. “Aren’t we a little bitchy today?”

“Sorry.”

“Just kidding. It’s great. Derrida is my absolute god!”

Almost overnight it became laughable to read writers like Cheever or Updike, who wrote about the suburbia Madeleine and most of her friends had grown up in, in favor of reading the Marquis de Sade, who wrote about anally deflowering virgins in eighteenth-century France.

The reason de Sade was preferable was that his shocking sex scenes weren’t about sex but politics. They were therefore anti-imperialist, anti-bourgeois, anti-patriarchal, and anti-everything a smart young feminist should be against. Right up through her third year at college, Madeleine kept wholesomely taking courses like Victorian Fantasy: From Phantastes to The Water-Babies, but by senior year she could no longer ignore the contrast between the hard-up, blinky people in her Beowulf seminar and the hipsters down the hall reading Maurice Blanchot.

Going to college in the moneymaking eighties lacked a certain radicalism. Semiotics was the first thing that smacked of revolution. It drew a line; it created an elect; it was sophisticated and Continental; it dealt with provocative subjects, with torture, sadism, hermaphroditism—with sex and power.

Madeleine had always been popular at school. Years of being popular had left her with the reflexive ability to separate the cool from the uncool, even within subgroups, like the English department, where the concept of cool didn’t appear to obtain.

If Restoration drama was getting you down, if scanning Wordsworth was making you feel dowdy and ink-stained, there was another option. You could flee K. McCall Saunders and the old New Criticism. You could defect to the new imperium of Derrida and Eco. You could sign up for Semiotics 211 and find out what everyone else was talking about.



Semiotics 211 was limited to ten students. Of the ten, eight had taken Introduction to Semiotic Theory. This was visually apparent at the first class meeting.

Lounging around the seminar table, when Madeleine came into the room from the wintry weather outside, were eight people in black T-shirts and ripped black jeans. A few had razored off the necks or sleeves of their T-shirts. There was something creepy about one guy’s face—it was like a baby’s face that had grown whiskers—and it took Madeleine a full minute to realize that he’d shaved off his eyebrows.

Everyone in the room was so spectral-looking that Madeleine’s natural healthiness seemed suspect, like a vote for Reagan. She was relieved, therefore, when a big guy in a down jacket and snowmobile boots showed up and took the empty seat next to her. He had a cup of take-out coffee.

Zipperstein asked the students to introduce themselves and explain why they were taking the seminar.

The boy without eyebrows spoke up first. “Um, let’s see. I’m finding it hard to introduce myself, actually, because the whole idea of social introductions is so problematized.

Like, if I tell you that my name is Thurston Meems and that I grew up in Stamford, Connecticut, will you know who I am? O.K.

My name’s Thurston and I’m from Stamford, Connecticut. I’m taking this course because I read Of Grammatology last summer and it blew my mind.”

When it was the turn of the boy next to Madeleine, he said in a quiet voice that he was a double major (biology and philosophy) and had never taken a semiotics course before, that his parents had named him Leonard, that it had always seemed pretty handy to have a name, especially when you were being called to dinner, and that if anyone wanted to call him Leonard he would answer to it.

Leonard didn’t make another comment. During the rest of the class, he leaned back in his chair, stretching out his long legs. After he finished his coffee, he dug into his right snowmobile boot and, to Madeleine’s surprise, pulled out a tin of chewing tobacco. With two stained fingers, he placed a wad of tobacco in his cheek. For the next two hours, every minute or so, he spat, discreetly but audibly, into the cup.

Every week Zipperstein assigned one daunting book of theory and one literary selection. The pairings were eccentric if not downright arbitrary. (What did Saussure’s Writings in General Linguistics, for instance, have to do with Pynchon’s The Crying of Lot 49?) As for Zipperstein himself, he didn’t run the class so much as observe it from behind the one-way mirror of his opaque personality. He hardly said a word. He asked questions now and then to stimulate discussion, and often went to the window to gaze in the direction of Narragansett Bay, as if thinking about his wooden sloop in dry dock.

Three weeks into the course, on a February day of flurries and gray skies, they read Zipperstein’s own book, The Making of Signs, along with Peter Handke’s A Sorrow Beyond Dreams.

It was always embarrassing when professors assigned their own books. Even Madeleine, who found all the reading hard going, could tell that Zipperstein’s contribution to the field was reformulative and second-tier.

Everyone seemed a little hesitant when talking about The Making of Signs, so it was a relief when, after the break, they turned to the literary selection.

“So,” Zipperstein asked, blinking behind his round wire-rims. “What did you make of the Handke?”

After a short silence, Thurston spoke up. “The Handke was totally dank and depressing,” he said. “I loved it.”

Thurston was a sly-looking boy with short, gelled hair. His eyebrowlessness, along with his pale complexion, gave his face a superintelligent quality, like a floating, disembodied brain.

“Care to elaborate?” Zipperstein said.

“Well, Professor, here’s a subject dear to my heart—offing yourself.” The other students tittered as Thurston warmed to his topic.

“It’s purportedly autobiographical, this book. But I’d contend, with Barthes, that the act of writing is itself a fictionalization, even if you’re treating actual events.”

Bart. So that was how you pronounced it. Madeleine made a note, grateful to be spared humiliation.

Meanwhile Thurston was saying, “So Handke’s mother commits suicide and Handke sits down to write about it. He wants to be as objective as possible, to be totally—remorseless!”

Thurston stifled a smile. He aspired to be a person who would react to his own mother’s suicide with high-literary remorselessness, and his soft, young face lit up with pleasure. “Suicide is a trope,” he announced.

“Especially in German literature. You’ve got The Sorrows of Young Werther. You’ve got Kleist. Hey, I just thought of something.” He held up a finger.

“The Sorrows of Young Werther.” He held up another finger.

“A Sorrow Beyond Dreams. My theory is that Handke felt the weight of all that tradition and this book was his attempt to break free.”

“How do you mean ‘free’?” Zipperstein said.

“From the whole Teutonic, Sturm-und-Drang, suicidal thing.”

The flurries swirling outside the windows looked like either flakes of soap or flash of ash, like something either very clean or very dirty.

“The Sorrows of Young Werther is an apt reference,” Zipperstein said.

“But I think that’s more the translator’s doing than Handke’s. In German the book’s called Wunschloses Unglück.”

Thurston smiled, either because he was pleased to be receiving Zipperstein’s full attention or because he thought German sounded funny.

“It’s a play on a German saying, wunschlos glücklich, which means being happier than you could ever wish for. Only here Handke makes a nice reversal. It’s a serious and strangely wonderful title.”

“So it means being unhappier than you could ever wish for,” Madeleine said.

Zipperstein looked at her for the first time.

“In a sense. As I said, something is lost in translation. What was your take?”

“On the book?” Madeleine asked, and immediately realized how stupid this sounded. She fell silent, the blood beating in her ears.

People blushed in nineteenth-century English novels but never in contemporary Austrian ones.

Before the silence became uncomfortable, Leonard came to her rescue.

“I have a comment,” he said. “If I was going to write about my mother’s suicide, I don’t think I’d be too concerned about being experimental.” He leaned forward, putting his elbows on the table.

“I mean, wasn’t anybody put off by Handke’s so-called remorselessness? Didn’t this book strike anyone as a tad cold?”

“Better cold than sentimental,” Thurston said.

“Do you think? Why?”

“Because we’ve read the sentimental, filial account of a cherished dead parent before. We’ve read it a million times. It doesn’t have any power anymore.”

“I’m doing a little thought experiment here,” Leonard said.

“Say my mother killed herself. And say I wrote a book about it.

Why would I want to do something like that?” He closed his eyes and leaned his head back.

“First, I’d do it to cope with my grief. Second, maybe to paint a portrait of my mother. To keep her alive in my memory.”

“And you think your reaction is universal,” Thurston said.

“That because you’d respond to the death of a parent a certain way, that obligates Handke to do the same.”

“I’m saying that if your mother kills herself it’s not a literary trope.”

Madeleine’s heart had quieted now. She was listening to the discussion with interest.

Thurston was nodding his head in a way that somehow didn’t suggest agreement.

“Yeah, O.K.,” he said. “Handke’s real mother killed herself. She died in a real world and Handke felt real grief or whatever. But that’s not what this book’s about. Books aren’t about ‘real life.’ Books are about other books.” He raised his mouth like a wind instrument and blew out bright notes.

“My theory is that the problem Handke was trying to solve here, from a literary standpoint, was how do you write about something, even something real and painful—like suicide—when all of the writing that’s been done on that subject has robbed you of any originality of expression?”

What Thurston was saying seemed to Madeleine both insightful and horribly wrong. It was maybe true, what he said, but it shouldn’t have been.

“‘Popular literature,’” Zipperstein quipped, proposing an essay title. “‘Or, How to Beat a Dead Horse.’”

A spasm of mirth traveled through the class. Madeleine looked over to see that Leonard was staring at her. When the class ended, he gathered up his books and left.

She started seeing Leonard around after that. She saw him crossing the green one afternoon, hatless in winter drizzle. She saw him at Mutt & Geoff’s, eating a messy Buddy Cianci sandwich. She saw him, one morning, waiting for a bus on South Main. Each time, Leonard was alone, looking forlorn and uncombed like a great big motherless boy. At the same time, he appeared somehow older than most guys at school.

It was Madeleine’s last semester of senior year, a time when she was supposed to have some fun, and she wasn’t having any. She’d never thought of herself as hard up. She preferred to think of her current boyfriendless state as salutary and head-clearing. But when she found herself wondering what it would be like to kiss a guy who chewed tobacco, she began to worry that she was fooling herself.

Looking back, Madeleine realized that her college love life had fallen short of expectations. Her freshman roommate, Jennifer Boomgaard, had rushed off to Health Services the first week of school to be fitted for a diaphragm. Unaccustomed to sharing a room with anybody, much less a stranger, Madeleine felt that Jenny was a little too quick with her intimacies. She didn’t want to be shown Jennifer’s diaphragm, which reminded her of an uncooked ravioli, and she certainly didn’t want to feel the spermicidal jelly that Jenny offered to squirt into her palm. Madeleine was shocked when Jennifer started going to parties with the diaphragm already in place, when she wore it to the Harvard-Brown game, and when she left it one morning on top of their miniature fridge. That winter, when the Rev. Desmond Tutu came to campus for an anti-apartheid rally, Madeleine asked Jennifer on their way to see the great cleric, “Did you put your diaphragm in?” They lived the next four months in an eighteen-by-fifteen room without speaking to each other.

Though Madeleine hadn’t arrived at college sexually inexperienced, her freshman learning curve resembled a flat line. Aside from one make-out session with a Uruguayan named Carlos, a sandal-wearing engineering student who in low light looked like Che Guevara, the only boy she’d fooled around with was a high school senior visiting campus for Early Action weekend. She found Tim standing in line at the Ratty, pushing his cafeteria tray along the metal track, and visibly quivering. His blue blazer was too big for him. He’d spent the entire day wandering around campus with no one speaking to him. Now he was starving and wasn’t sure if he was allowed to eat in the cafeteria or not. Tim seemed to be the only person at Brown more lost than Madeleine. She helped him negotiate the Ratty and, afterward, took him on a tour of the university. Finally, around ten-thirty that night, they ended up back in Madeleine’s dorm room. Tim had the long-lashed eyes and pretty features of an expensive Bavarian doll, a little prince or yodeling shepherd boy. His blue blazer was on the floor and Madeleine’s shirt unbuttoned when Jennifer Boomgaard came through the door. “Oh,” she said, “sorry,” and proceeded to stand there, smiling at the floor as if already relishing how this juicy bit of gossip would play along the hall. When she finally did leave, Madeleine sat up and readjusted her clothes, and Tim picked up his blazer and went back to high school.

At Christmas, when Madeleine went home for vacation, she thought the scale in her parents’ bathroom was broken. She got off to recalibrate the dial and got back on, whereupon the scale again registered the same weight. Stepping in front of the mirror, Madeleine encountered a worried chipmunk staring back.

“Am I not getting asked out because I’m fat,” the chipmunk said, “or am I fat because I’m not getting asked out?”

“I never got the freshman fifteen,” her sister gloated when Madeleine came down to breakfast.

“But I didn’t pig out like all my friends did.” Accustomed to Alwyn’s teasing, Madeleine paid no attention, quietly slicing and eating the first of the fifty-seven grapefruits she subsisted on until New Year’s.

Dieting fooled you into thinking you could control your life. By January, Madeleine was down five pounds, and by the time squash season ended she was back in great shape, and still she didn’t meet anyone she liked. The boys at college seemed either incredibly immature or prematurely middle-aged, bearded like therapists, warming brandy snifters over candles while listening to Coltrane’s A Love Supreme. It wasn’t until her junior year that Madeleine had a serious boyfriend. Billy Bainbridge was the son of Dorothy Bainbridge, whose uncle owned a third of the newspapers in the United States. Billy had flushed cheeks, blond curls, and a scar on his right temple that made him even more adorable than he already was. He was soft-spoken and nice-smelling, like Ivory soap. Naked, his body was nearly hairless.

Billy didn’t like to talk about his family. Madeleine took this as a sign of good breeding. Billy was a legacy at Brown and sometimes worried that he wouldn’t have gotten in on his own. Sex with Billy was cozy, it was snuggly, it was perfectly fine. He wanted to be a filmmaker. The one film he made for Advanced Filmmaking, however, was a violent, unbroken twelve minutes of Billy throwing fecal-looking brownie mix at the camera. Madeleine began to wonder if there was a reason he never talked about his family.

One thing he did talk about, however, with increasing intensity, was circumcision. Billy had read an article in an alternative health magazine that argued against the practice, and it made a big impression on him.

“If you think about it, it’s a pretty weird thing to do to a baby,” he said. “Cut off part of its dick? What’s so different about a tribe in, like, Papua New Guinea putting bones through their noses and cutting off a baby’s foreskin? A bone through the nose is a lot less invasive.” Madeleine listened, trying to look sympathetic, and hoped Billy would drop the subject. But as the weeks passed he kept returning to it.

“The doctors just do it automatically in this country,” he said.

“They didn’t ask my parents. It’s not like I’m Jewish or anything.” He derided justifications on the basis of health or hygiene. “Maybe that made sense three thousand years ago, out in the desert, when you couldn’t take a shower. But now?”

One night, as they were lying in bed, naked, Madeleine noticed Billy examining his penis, stretching it.

“What are you doing?” she asked.

“I’m looking for the scar,” he said somberly.

He interrogated his European friends, Henrik the Intact, Olivier the Foreskinned, asking,

“But does it feel supersensitive?” Billy was convinced that he’d been deprived of sensation. Madeleine tried not to take this personally. Plus there were other problems with their relationship by then. Billy had a habit of staring deeply into Madeleine’s eyes in a way that was somehow controlling. His roommate situation was odd. He lived off campus with an attractive, muscular girl named Kyle who was sleeping with at least three people, including Fatima Shirazi, a niece of the shah of Iran. On the wall of his living room Billy had painted the words Kill the Father. Killing the father was what, in Billy’s opinion, college was all about.

“Who’s your father?” he asked Madeleine. “Is it Virginia Woolf? Is it Sontag?”

“In my case,” Madeleine said, “my father really is my father.”

“Then you have to kill him.”

“Who’s your father?”

“Godard,” he said.

Billy talked about renting a house in Guanajuato with Madeleine over the summer. He said she could write a novel while he made a film. His faith in her, in her writing (even though she hardly wrote any fiction), made Madeleine feel so good that she started going along with the idea. And then one day she came up onto Billy’s front porch and was about to rap on his window when something told her to look in the window instead. In the storm-tossed bed, Billy lay curled, John Lennon–style, against the spread-eagled Kyle. Both were naked. A second later, in a puff of smoke, Fatima materialized, also naked, shaking baby powder over her gleaming Persian skin. She smiled at her bedmates, her teeth seed-like in purple, royal gums.

Maddy’s next boyfriend wasn’t strictly her fault. She would never have met Dabney Carlisle if she hadn’t taken an acting class, and she would never have taken an acting class if it hadn’t been for her mother. As a young woman, Phyllida had wanted to be an actress. Her parents had been opposed, however.

“Acting wasn’t what people in our family, especially the ladies, did,” was the way Phyllida put it. Every so often, in reflective moods, she told her daughters the story of her one great disobedience. After graduating from college, Phyllida had “run away” to Hollywood. Without telling her parents, she’d flown out to Los Angeles, staying with a friend from Smith. She’d found a job as a secretary in an insurance company. She and the friend, a girl named Sally Peyton, moved into a bungalow in Santa Monica. In six months Phyllida had three auditions, one screen test, and “loads of invitations.” She’d once seen Jackie Gleason carrying a chihuahua into a restaurant. She’d developed a lustrous suntan she described as “Egyptian.” Whenever Phyllida spoke about this period in her life, it seemed as if she was talking about another person. As for Alton, he became quiet, fully aware that Phyllida’s loss had been his gain. It was on the train back to New York, the next Christmas, that she’d met the straight-backed lieutenant colonel, recently returned from Berlin. Phyllida never went back to L.A. She got married instead. “And had you two,” she told her daughters.

Phyllida’s inability to realize her dreams had given Madeleine her own. Her mother’s life was the great counterexample. It represented the injustice Madeleine’s life would rectify. To come of age simultaneously with a great social movement, to grow up in the age of Betty Friedan and ERA marches and Bella Abzug’s indomitable hats, to define your identity when it was being redefined, this was a freedom as great as any of the American freedoms Madeleine had read about in school. She could remember the night, in 1973, when her family gathered before the television in the den to watch the tennis match between Billie Jean King and Bobby Riggs. How she, Alwyn, and Phyllida had rooted for Billie Jean, while Alton had pulled for Bobby Riggs. How, as King ran Riggs back and forth across the court, outserving him, hitting winners he was too slow to return, Alton began to grumble.

“It’s not a fair fight! Riggs is too old.

If they want a real test, she should play Smith or Newcombe.”

But it didn’t matter what Alton said.

It didn’t matter that Bobby Riggs was fifty-five and King twenty-nine, or that Riggs hadn’t been an especially great player even in his prime. What mattered was that this tennis match was on national television, during prime time, billed for weeks as “The Battle of the Sexes,” and that the woman was winning. If any single moment defined Madeleine’s generation of girls, dramatized their aspirations, put into clear focus what they expected from themselves and from life, it was those two hours and fifteen minutes when the country watched a man in white shorts get thrashed by a woman, pummeled repeatedly until all he could do, after match point, was to jump feebly over the net. And even that was telling: you were supposed to jump the net when you won, not lost. So how male was that, to act like a winner when you’d just been creamed?

At the first meeting of Acting Workshop, Professor Churchill, a bald bullfrog of a man, asked the students to say something about themselves. Half the people in the class were theater majors, serious about acting or directing. Madeleine mumbled something about loving Shakespeare and Eugene O’Neill.

Dabney Carlisle stood up and said, “I’ve done a little modeling work, down in New York. My agent suggested I should take some acting lessons. So here I am.”

The modeling he’d done consisted of a single magazine ad, showing a group of Leni Riefenstahl–ish athletes in boxer briefs, standing in a receding line on a beach whose black volcanic sand steamed around their marble feet. Madeleine didn’t see the photograph until she and Dabney were already going out, when Dabney gingerly took it out of the bartending manual where he kept it safely pressed. She was inclined to make fun of it but something reverential in Dabney’s expression stopped her. And so she asked where the beach had been (Montauk) and why it was so black (it wasn’t) and how much he’d gotten paid (“four figures”) and what the other guys were like (“total a-holes”) and if he was wearing the underpants right now. It was sometimes difficult, with boys, to take an interest in the things that interested them. But with Dabney she wished it had been curling, she longed for it to be the model UN, anything but male modeling. This, anyway, was the authentic emotion she now identified herself as having felt. At the time—Dabney cautioned her against touching the ad before he got it laminated—Madeleine had rehearsed in her mind the standard arguments: that though objectification was de facto bad, the emergence of the idealized male form in the mass media scored a point for equality; that if men started getting objectified and started worrying about their looks and their bodies, they might begin to understand the burden women had been living with since forever, and might therefore be sensitized to these issues of the body. She even went so far as to admire Dabney for his courage in allowing himself to be photographed in snug little gray underpants.

Looking the way Madeleine and Dabney did, it was inevitable that they would be cast as romantic leads in the scenes the workshop performed. Madeleine was Rosalind to Dabney’s wooden Orlando, Maggie to his brick-like Brick in Cat on a Hot Tin Roof. To rehearse the first time, they met at Dabney’s fraternity house. Merely stepping through the front door reinforced Madeleine’s aversion to places like Sigma Chi. It was around ten on a Sunday morning. The vestiges of the previous evening’s “Hawaiian Night” were still there to see—the lei hanging from the antlers of the moose head on the wall, the plastic “grass” skirt trampled on the beer-sodden floor, a skirt that, should Madeleine succumb to the outrageous good looks of Dabney Carlisle, she might, at a minimum, have to watch some drunken slut hula in to the baying of the brothers, or, at a maximum (for mai tais made you do crazy things), might even don herself, up in Dabney’s room, for his pleasure alone. On the low-slung couch two Sigma Chi members were watching TV. At Madeleine’s appearance, they stirred, rising out of the gloom like openmouthed carp. She hurried to the back stairs, thinking the things she always thought when it came to frats and frat guys: that their appeal stemmed from a primitive need for protection (one thought of Neanderthal clans banding together against other Neanderthal clans); that the hazing the pledges underwent (being stripped and blindfolded and left in the lobby of the Biltmore Hotel with bus fare taped to their genitals) enacted the very fears of male rape and emasculation that membership in the fraternity promised protection against; that any guy who longed to join a frat suffered from insecurities that poisoned his relationships with women; that there was something seriously wrong with homophobic guys who centered their lives around a homoerotic bond; that the stately mansions maintained by generations of dues-paying fraternity members were in reality sites for date rape and problem drinking; that frats always smelled bad; that you didn’t ever want to shower in one; that only freshman girls were stupid enough to go to frat parties; that Kelly Traub had slept with a Sigma Delt guy who kept saying,

“Now you see it, now you don’t, now you see it, now you don’t”; that such a thing wasn’t going to happen to her, to Madeleine, ever.

What she hadn’t expected when it came to a fraternity was a sunny-haired silent type like Dabney, learning his lines in a folding chair, in parachute pants, shoeless. Looking back on their relationship, Madeleine figured she’d had no choice. Dabney and she had been selected for each other in a Royal Wedding kind of way. She was Prince Charles to his Princess Di. She knew he couldn’t act. Dabney had the artistic soul of a third-string tight end. In life Dabney moved and said little. Onstage he moved not at all but had to say a lot. His best dramatic moments came when the strain on his face from remembering his lines resembled the emotion he was trying to simulate.

Acting opposite Dabney made Madeleine more stiff and nervous than she already was. She wanted to do scenes with the talented kids in the workshop. She suggested interesting bits from The Vietnamization of New Jersey and Mamet’s Sexual Perversity in Chicago, but got no takers. Nobody wanted to lower his or her average by acting with her.

Dabney didn’t let it bother him. “Bunch of little shits in that class,” he said. “They’ll never get any print work, much less movies.”

He was more laconic than she liked her boyfriends to be. He had the wit of a store mannequin. But Dabney’s physical perfection pushed these realities out of her mind. She’d never been in a relationship where she wasn’t the more attractive partner. It was slightly intimidating. But she could handle it. At three a.m., while Dabney lay sleeping beside her, Madeleine found she was up to the task of inventorying each abdominal cord, every hard lump of muscle. She enjoyed applying calipers to Dabney’s waist to measure his body fat. Underwear modeling was all about the abs, Dabney said, and the abs were all about sit-ups and diet. The pleasure Madeleine got from looking at Dabney was reminiscent of the pleasure she’d gotten as a girl from looking at sleek hunting dogs. Underneath this pleasure, like the coals that fed it, was a fierce need to enfold Dabney and siphon off his strength and beauty. It was all very primitive and evolutionary and felt fantastic. The problem was that she hadn’t been able to allow herself to enjoy Dabney or even to exploit him a little, but had had to go and be a total girl about it and convince herself that she was in love with him. Madeleine required emotion, apparently. She disapproved of the idea of meaningless, extremely satisfying sex.

And so she began to tell herself that Dabney’s acting was “restrained” or “economical.” She appreciated that Dabney was “secure about himself” and “didn’t need to prove anything” and wasn’t a “showoff.” Instead of worrying that he was dull, Madeleine decided he was gentle. Instead of thinking he was poorly read, she called him intuitive. She exaggerated Dabney’s mental abilities in order not to feel shallow for wanting his body. To this end she helped Dabney write—O.K., she wrote—English and anthro papers for him and, when he got A’s, felt confirmed of his intelligence. She sent him off to modeling auditions in New York with good-luck kisses and listened to him complain bitterly about the “faggots” who hadn’t hired his services. It turned out that Dabney wasn’t so beautiful. Among the truly beautiful he was only so-so. He couldn’t even smile right.

At the end of the semester, the acting students met separately with the professor for a critical review. Churchill welcomed Madeleine with a wolfish yellow grin, then sat back jowly and deliberate in his chair.

“I’ve enjoyed having you in the class, Madeleine,” he said. “But you can’t act.”

“Don’t hold back,” Madeleine said, chastened but laughing. “Give it to me straight.”

“You have a good feel for language, for Shakespeare especially. But your voice is reedy and you look worried onstage. Your forehead has a perpetual crease. A vocal coach could go a long way toward helping your instrument. But I worry about your worrying. You’ve got it right now. The crease.”

“It’s called thinking.”

“Which is fine.

If you’re playing Eleanor Roosevelt. Or Golda Meir. But those parts don’t come around very often.”

Churchill, steepling his fingers, continued, “I’d be more diplomatic if I thought this meant a lot to you. But I get the feeling you don’t want to be a professional actress, do you?”

“No,” Madeleine said.

“Good. You’re lovely. You’re bright. The world is your oyster. Go with my blessings.”

When Dabney returned from his review with Churchill, he looked even more self-contented than usual.

“So?” Madeleine asked. “How did it go?”

“He says I’m perfect for soaps.”

“Soap commercials?”

Dabney looked peeved. “Days of Our Lives. General Hospital. Ever heard of those?”

“Did he mean that as a compliment?”

“How else could he mean it? Soap actors have it made! They work every day, make great money, and never have to travel. I’ve been wasting my time trying to get all this advertising work. Screw that. I’m going to tell my agent to start lining up some auditions for soaps.”

Madeleine was silent at this news. She’d assumed Dabney’s enthusiasm for modeling was temporary, a tuition-earning scheme. Now she realized he was in earnest. She was, in fact, dating a model.

“What are you thinking?” Dabney asked her.

“Nothing.”

“Tell me.”

“Just that—I don’t know—but I doubt Prof. Churchill has that high of an opinion of the acting on Days of Our Lives.”

“What did he tell us the first class? He said he was giving a workshop in acting. For people who wanted to work in the theater.”

“In the theater doesn’t mean …”

“What did he tellyou? Did he say you were going to be a movie star?”

“He told me I couldn’t act,” Madeleine said.

“He did, huh?” Dabney put his hands in his pockets, leaning back on his heels as if relieved not to have to deliver this verdict himself. “Is that why you’re so pissed off? And have to tear down my crit?”

“I’m not tearing down your crit. I’m just not sure you got Churchill’s meaning, exactly.”

Dabney let out a bitter laugh. “I wouldn’t get it right, would I? I’m too dumb. I’m just some dumb jock you have to write English papers for.”

“I don’t know. You seem to have a pretty good grasp of sarcasm.”

“Man, am I ever lucky,” Dabney said.

“What would I do if you weren’t around?

You have to catch all the subtleties for me, don’t you? You and your flair for catching subtleties. It must be nice to be rich and sit around all day catching subtleties.

What do you know about needing to make a living?

It’s fine for you to make fun of my ad. You didn’t get into college on a football scholarship. And now you have to come in here and run me down.

You know what? This is bullshit. This is total bullshit. I’m sick of your condescension and your superiority complex. And Churchill’s right. You can’t act.”

In the end Madeleine had to admit that Dabney was far more fluent than she’d ever expected. He was capable of portraying a range of emotions, too, anger, disgust, wounded pride, and of simulating others, including affection, passion, and love. He had a great career in the soaps ahead of him.



Madeleine and Dabney had broken up in May, right before summer, and there was no better time than summer to forget about somebody. She’d gone straight down to Prettybrook the day she finished her last exam. For once she was glad to have such sociable parents. With all the cocktail parties and convivial dinners on Wilson Lane there was little time to dwell on herself. In July, she got an internship at a nonprofit poetry organization on the Upper East Side and began riding the train into the city. Madeleine’s job was to oversee submissions for the annual New Voices award, which involved making sure that the submissions were complete before sending them off to the judge (Howard Nemerov, that year). Madeleine wasn’t particularly technical, but because everyone else in the office was even less so, she ended up being the go-to person whenever the copier or the dot-matrix printer malfunctioned. Her coworker Brenda would come up to Madeleine’s desk at least once a week and ask in a babyish voice,

“Can you help me? The printer’s not being nice.” The only part of the day Madeleine enjoyed was her lunch hour, when she got to walk around the muggy, stinking, thrilling streets, eat quiche in a French bistro as narrow as a bowling alley, and stare at the styles women her age or a little older were wearing. When the one straight guy at the nonprofit asked her to have a drink after work,

Madeleine cooly answered, “Sorry, I can’t,” trying not to feel bad about hurting his feelings, trying to think about her own feelings for a change.

She arrived back at college for her senior year, then, intent on being studious, career-oriented, and aggressively celibate. Casting a wide net, Madeleine sent away for applications to Yale grad school (English Language and Literature), an organization for teaching English in China, and an advertising internship at Foote, Cone & Belding, in Chicago. She studied for the GRE using a sample booklet. The verbal section was easy. The math required brushing up on her high school algebra. The logic problems, however, were a defeat to the spirit. “At the annual dancers’ ball a number of dancers performed their favorite dance with their favorite partners. Alan danced the tango, while Becky watched the waltz. James and Charlotte were fantastic together. Keith was magnificent during his foxtrot and Simon excelled at the rumba. Jessica danced with Alan. But Laura did not dance with Simon. Can you determine who danced with whom and which dance they each enjoyed?” Logic wasn’t something Madeleine had been expressly taught. It seemed unfair to be asked about it. She did as the book suggested, diagramming the problems, placing Alan, Becky, James, Charlotte, Keith, Simon, Jessica, and Laura on the dance floor of her scrap paper, and pairing them according to the instructions. But their complicated transit wasn’t a subject Madeleine’s mind naturally followed. She wanted to know why James and Charlotte were fantastic together, and if Jessica and Alan were going out, and why Laura wouldn’t dance with Simon, and if Becky was upset, watching.

One afternoon, on the bulletin board outside Hillel House, Madeleine noticed a flyer announcing the Melvin and Hetty Greenberg Fellowship for summer study at Hebrew University in Jerusalem, and she applied for that. Using contacts of Alton’s in the publishing world, she put on a business suit and went down to New York for an informational interview with an editor at Simon and Schuster. The editor, Terry Wirth, had once been a bright, idealistic English major just like Madeleine, but she found him that afternoon, in his tiny, manuscript-piled office looking onto the gloomy canyon of Sixth Avenue, a middle-aged father of two with a salary far below the median of his former classmates and a nasty, hour-and-fifteen-minute commute to his split-level in Montclair, New Jersey. On the prospects of a book he was publishing that month, the memoir of a migrant farmer,

Wirth said, “Now’s the calm before the calm.” He gave Madeleine a stack of manuscripts from the slush pile to critique, offering to pay her fifty bucks a pop.

Instead of reading the manuscripts, Madeleine took the subway down to the East Village. After buying a bag of pignoli cookies at De Robertis, she plunged into a hair salon, where, on a whim, she allowed a butch woman with a short, rat-tailed haircut to go to work on her.

“Cut it close on the sides, higher on top,” Madeleine said.

“You sure?” the woman said.

“I’m sure,” Madeleine answered. To show her resolve, she took off her glasses. Forty-five minutes later, she put her glasses back on, horror-struck and elated at the transformation. Her head was really quite enormous. She had never fathomed its true size. She looked like Annie Lennox, or David Bowie. Like someone the hairdresser might be dating.

The Annie Lennox look was O.K., however. Androgyny was just the thing. Once she was back at school, Madeleine’s haircut proclaimed her serious frame of mind, and by the end of the year, when her bangs had grown out to a maddening length she didn’t know what to do with, she remained firm in her renunciations. (Her only slip-up had been the night in her bedroom with Mitchell, but nothing had happened.) Madeleine had her thesis to write. She had her future to figure out. The last thing she needed was a boy to distract her from her work and disturb her equilibrium. But then, during spring semester, she met Leonard Bankhead and her resolve went out the window.

He shaved irregularly. His Skoal had a menthol scent, cleaner, more pleasant than Madeleine expected. Whenever she looked up to find Leonard staring at her with his St. Bernard’s eyes (the eyes of a drooler, maybe, but also of a loyal brute who could dig you out of an avalanche), Madeleine couldn’t help staring back a significant moment longer.

One evening in early March, when she went to the Rockefeller Library to pick up the reserve reading for Semiotics 211, she found Leonard there as well. He was leaning against the counter, speaking animatedly to the girl on duty, who was unfortunately rather cute in a busty Bettie Page way.

“Think about it, though,” Leonard was saying to the girl. “Think about it from the point of view of the fly.”

“O.K., I’m a fly,” the girl said with a throaty laugh.

“We move in slow motion to them. They can see the swatter coming from a million miles away. The flies are like, ‘Wake me when the swatter gets close.’”

Noticing Madeleine, the girl told Leonard, “Just a sec.”

Madeleine held out her call order slip, and the girl took it and went off into the stacks.

“Picking up the Balzac?” Leonard said.

“Yes.”

“Balzac to the rescue.”

Normally, Madeleine would have had many things to say to this, many comments about Balzac to make. But her mind was a blank. She didn’t even remember to smile until he’d looked away.

Bettie Page came back with Madeleine’s order, sliding it toward her and immediately turning back to Leonard. He seemed different than he did in class, more exuberant, supercharged. He raised his eyebrows in a crazed, Jack Nicholson way and said,

“My house fly theory is related to my theory about why time seems to go faster as you get older.”

“Why’s that?” the girl asked.

“It’s proportional,” Leonard explained. “When you’re five, you’ve only been alive a couple thousand days. But by the time you’re fifty, you’ve lived around twenty thousand days. So a day when you’re five seems longer because it’s a greater percentage of the whole.”

“Yeah, sure,” the girl teased, “that follows.”

But Madeleine had understood. “That makes sense,” she said. “I always wondered why that was.”

“It’s just a theory,” Leonard said.

Bettie Page tapped Leonard’s hand to get his attention.

“Flies aren’t always so fast,” she said.

“I’ve caught flies in my bare hands before.”

“Especially in winter,” Leonard said.

“That’s probably the kind of fly I’d be. One of those knucklehead winter flies.”

There was no good excuse for Madeleine to hang around the reserve reading room, and so she put the Balzac into her bag and headed out.

She began to dress differently on the days she had semiotics. She took out her diamond studs, leaving her ears bare. She stood in front of the mirror wondering if her Annie Hall glasses might possibly project a New Wave look. She decided not and wore her contacts. She unearthed a pair of Beatle boots she’d bought at a church basement sale in Vinalhaven. She put up her collar, and wore more black.

In Week Four, Zipperstein assigned Umberto Eco’s The Role of the Reader. It hadn’t done much for Madeleine. She wasn’t all that interested, as a reader, in the reader. She was still partial to that increasingly eclipsed entity: the writer. Madeleine had a feeling that most semiotic theorists had been unpopular as children, often bullied or overlooked, and so had directed their lingering rage onto literature. They wanted to demote the author. They wanted a book, that hard-won, transcendent thing, to be a text, contingent, indeterminate, and open for suggestions. They wanted the reader to be the main thing. Because they were readers.

Whereas Madeleine was perfectly happy with the idea of genius. She wanted a book to take her places she couldn’t get to herself. She thought a writer should work harder writing a book than she did reading it. When it came to letters and literature, Madeleine championed a virtue that had fallen out of esteem: namely, clarity. The week after they read Eco, they read portions of Derrida’s Writing and Difference. The week after that, they read Jonathan Culler’s On Deconstruction, and Madeleine came to class ready to contribute to the discussion for the first time. Before she could do so, however, Thurston beat her to it.

“The Culler was passable at best,” Thurston said.

“What didn’t you like about it?” the professor asked him.

Thurston had his knee up against the edge of the seminar table. He pushed his chair up on its back legs, scrunching up his face. “It’s readable and everything,” he said. “And well argued and all that. But it’s just a question of whether you can use a discredited discourse—like, say, reason—to explicate something as paradigmatically revolutionary as deconstruction.”

Madeleine searched along the table for mutual eye-rolling but the other students seemed eager to hear what Thurston had to say.

“Care to elaborate?” Zipperstein said.

“Well, what I mean is, first off, reason is just a discourse like any other, right? It’s only been imbued with a sense of absolute truth because it’s the privileged discourse of the West. What Derrida’s saying is that you have to use reason because, you know, reason is all there is. But at the same time you have to be aware that language is by its very nature unreasonable. You have to reason yourself out of reasonableness.” He pulled up the sleeve of his T-shirt and scratched his bony shoulder. “Culler, on the other hand, is still operating in the old mode. Mono as opposed to stereo. So from that point of view, I found the book, yeah, a little bit disappointing.”

A silence ensued. And deepened.

“I don’t know,” Madeleine said, glancing at Leonard for support.

“Maybe it’s just me, but wasn’t it a relief to read a logical argument for once? Culler boils down everything Eco and Derrida are saying into a digestible form.”

Thurston turned his head slowly to gaze across the seminar table at her.

“I’m not saying it’s bad,” he said. “It’s fine. But Culler’s work is of a different order than Derrida. Every genius needs an explainer. That’s what Culler is for Derrida.”

Madeleine shrugged this off. “I got a lot better idea of what deconstruction is from reading Culler than from reading Derrida.”

Thurston took pains to give her point of view full consideration. “It’s the nature of a simplification to be simple,” he said.

Class ended shortly after that, leaving Madeleine fuming. As she was coming out of Sayles Hall, she saw Leonard standing on the steps, holding a Coke can. She went right up to him and said, “Thanks for the help.”

“Excuse me?”

“I thought you were on my side. Why didn’t you say anything in class?”

“First Law of Thermodynamics,” Leonard said. “Conservation of energy.”

“Didn’t you agree with me?”

“I did and I didn’t,” Leonard said.

“You didn’t like the Culler?”

“The Culler’s good. But Derrida’s a heavyweight. You can’t just write him off.”

Madeleine looked dubious, but Derrida wasn’t who she was mad at. “Considering how Thurston’s always going on about how much he worships language, you’d think he wouldn’t parrot so much jargon. He used the word phallus three times today.”

Leonard smiled. “Figures if he says it it’ll be like having one.”

“He drives me crazy.”

“You want to get some coffee?”

“And fascist. That’s another of his favorites. You know the dry cleaners on Thayer Street? He called them fascist.”

“Must have gone extra heavy on the starch.”

“Yes,” Madeleine said.

“Yes, what?”

“You just invited me for coffee.”

“I did?” Leonard said. “Yes, I did. O.K. Let’s go get coffee.”

Leonard didn’t want to go to the Blue Room. He said he didn’t like to be around college students. They headed through Wayland Arch up to Hope Street, in the direction of Fox Point.

As they walked, Leonard spat into his Coke can every so often.

“Pardon my disgusting habit,” he said.

Madeleine wrinkled up her nose. “Are you going to keep doing that?”

“No,” Leonard said. “I don’t even know why I do it. It’s just something I picked up from my rodeo days.”

At the next trash can they came to, he tossed the Coke and spat out his wad of tobacco.

Within a few blocks pretty campus plantings of tulip and daffodil gave way to treeless streets lined by working-class houses painted in cheerful hues. They passed a Portuguese bakery and a Portuguese fish store selling sardines and cuttlefish. The kids here had no yards to play in but seemed happy enough, wheeling back and forth along the blank sidewalks. Nearer the highway, there were a few warehouses and, on the corner of Wickenden, a local diner.

Leonard wanted to sit at the counter. “I need to be close to the pies,” he said. “I need to see which one is talking to me.”

As Madeleine took a stool next to him, Leonard stared at the dessert case.

“Do you remember when they used to serve slices of cheese with apple pie?” he asked.

“Vaguely,” Madeleine said.

“They don’t seem to do that anymore. You and I are probably the only two people in this place who remember it.”

“Actually, I don’t remember it,” Madeleine said.

“You don’t? Never had a little slice of Wisconsin cheddar with your apple pie? I’m sorry to hear that.”

“Maybe they’ll put a slice of cheese on a piece if you ask them.”

“I didn’t say I liked it. I’m just mourning its passage.”

The conversation lapsed. And suddenly, to her surprise, Madeleine was flooded with panic. She felt the silence like a judgment against her. At the same time, her anxiety about the silence made it even harder to speak.

Though it didn’t feel nice to be so nervous, it did feel nice, in a way. It had been a while since Madeleine had been that way around a guy.

The waitress was down at the end of the counter talking to another customer.

“So why are you taking Zipperstein’s class?” she asked.

“Philosophical interest,” Leonard said. “Literally. Philosophy’s all about theory of language right now. It’s all linguistics. So I figured I’d check it out.”

“Aren’t you a biology major, too?”

“That’s what I really am,” Leonard said. “The philosophy’s just a sideline.”

Madeleine realized that she’d never dated a science major.

“Do you want to be a doctor?”

“Right now all I want to do is get the waitress’s attention.”

Leonard waved his arm a few times to no avail. Suddenly he said, “Is it hot in here?”

Without waiting for an answer, he reached into the back pocket of his jeans and pulled out a blue bandanna, which he proceeded to put over his head, tying it in back and making a number of small, precise adjustments until he was satisfied. Madeleine watched this with a slight feeling of disappointment. She associated bandannas with hacky sack, the Grateful Dead, and alfalfa sprouts, all of which she could do without. Still, she was impressed with Leonard’s sheer size on the stool next to her. His largeness, coupled with the softness—the delicacy, almost—of his voice, gave Madeleine a strange fairytale feeling, as if she were a princess sitting beside a gentle giant.

“The thing is, though,” Leonard said, still staring in the waitress’s direction,

“I didn’t get interested in philosophy because of linguistics. I got interested for the eternal verities. To learn how to die, et cetera. Now it’s more like, ‘What do we mean when we say we die?’

‘What do we mean we mean when we say we die?’”

Finally, the waitress came over. Madeleine ordered the cottage cheese plate and coffee. Leonard ordered apple pie and coffee. When the waitress left, he spun his stool rightward, so that their knees briefly touched.

“How very female of you,” he said.

“Sorry?”

“Cottage cheese.”

“I like cottage cheese.”

“Are you on a diet? You don’t look like someone on a diet.”

“Why do you want to know?” Madeleine said.

And here, for the first time, Leonard appeared rattled. Beneath the line of the bandanna, his face colored, and he spun away, breaking eye contact. “Just curious,” he said.

In the next second, he spun back, resuming the previous conversation. “Derrida’s supposed to be a lot clearer in French,” he said. “Rumor has it his prose in French is limpid.”

“Maybe I should read it in French, then.”

“You know French?” Leonard said, sounding impressed.

“I’m not great. I can read Flaubert.”

It was then that Madeleine made a big mistake. Things were going so well with Leonard, the mood was so promising—even the weather lending a hand because, after they finished their food and left the diner, walking back to campus, a March drizzle forced them to share Madeleine’s collapsible umbrella—that a feeling came over her like those she’d had as a girl when treated to a pastry or a dessert, a happiness so fraught by an awareness of its brevity that she took the tiniest bites, making the cream puff or éclair last as long as possible. In this same way, instead of seeing where the afternoon led, Madeleine decided to check its progress, to save some for later, and she told Leonard she had to go home and study.

They didn’t kiss goodbye. They didn’t come close to it.

Leonard, hunching under the umbrella, abruptly said “Bye” and hurried off through the rain, keeping his head down. Madeleine went back to the Narragansett. She lay down on her bed, and didn’t move for a long time.

The days dragged until the next meeting of Sem 211. Madeleine arrived early, choosing a seat at the seminar table next to Leonard’s usual spot. But when he showed up, ten minutes late, he took an available chair next to the professor. He didn’t say anything in class or glance in Madeleine’s direction even once. His face looked swollen and there was a line of blemishes running down one cheek. When the class ended, Leonard was the first one out the door.

The next week he missed class entirely.

And so Madeleine was left to contend with semiotics, and with Zipperstein and his disciples, all by herself.

By now they had moved on to Derrida’s Of Grammatology. The Derrida went like this: “In that sense, it is the Aufhebung of other writings, particularly of hieroglyphic script and of the Leibnizian characteristic that had been criticized previously through one and the same gesture.” In poetic moods, the Derrida went like this: “What writing itself, in its nonphonetic moment, betrays, is life. It menaces at once the breath, the spirit, and history as the spirit’s relationship with itself. It is their end, their finitude, their paralysis.”

Since Derrida claimed that language, by its very nature, undermined any meaning it attempted to promote, Madeleine wondered how Derrida expected her to get his meaning. Maybe he didn’t. That was why he deployed so much arcane terminology, so many loop-de-looping clauses. That was why he said what he said in sentences it took a minute to identify the subjects of. (Could “the access to pluridimensionality and to a delinearized temporality” really be a subject?)

Reading a novel after reading semiotic theory was like jogging empty-handed after jogging with hand weights. After getting out of Semiotics 211, Madeleine fled to the Rockefeller Library, down to B Level, where the stacks exuded a vivifying smell of mold, and grabbed something—anything, The House of Mirth, Daniel Deronda—to restore herself to sanity. How wonderful it was when one sentence followed logically from the sentence before! What exquisite guilt she felt, wickedly enjoying narrative! Madeleine felt safe with a nineteenth-century novel. There were going to be people in it. Something was going to happen to them in a place resembling the world.

Then, too, there were lots of weddings in Wharton and Austen. There were all kinds of irresistible gloomy men.

The next Thursday, Madeleine came to class wearing a Norwegian sweater with a snowflake design. She’d gone back to her glasses. For the second week in a row, Leonard didn’t show up. Madeleine worried that he’d dropped the class, but it was too late in the semester to do that. Zipperstein said,

“Has anybody seen Mr. Bankhead? Is he sick?” Nobody knew. Thurston arrived with a girl named Cassandra Hart, both of them sniffly and heroin-pale. Taking out a black Flair pen, Thurston wrote on Cassandra’s bare shoulder,

“Not Real Skin.”

Zipperstein was in a lively mood. He’d just returned from a conference in New York, dressed differently than usual. Listening to him talk about the paper he’d given at the New School, Madeleine suddenly understood. Semiotics was the form Zipperstein’s midlife crisis had taken. Becoming a semiotician allowed Zipperstein to wear a leather jacket, to fly off to Douglas Sirk retrospectives in Vancouver, and to get all the sexy waifs in his classes. Instead of leaving his wife, Zipperstein had left the English department. Instead of buying a sports car, he’d bought deconstruction.

He sat at the seminar table now and started speaking:

“I hope you read the Semiotext(e) for this week. Apropos of Lyotard, and in homage to Gertrude Stein, let me suggest the following: the thing about desire is that there is no there there.”

That was it. That was Zipperstein’s prompt. He sat before them, blinking, waiting for somebody to reply. He appeared to have all the patience in the world.

Madeleine had wanted to know what semiotics was. She’d wanted to know what the fuss was about. Well, now she felt she knew.

But then, in Week Ten, for reasons that were entirely extracurricular, semiotics began making sense.

It was a Friday night in April, just past eleven, and Madeleine was in bed, reading. The assigned text for that week was Roland Barthes’ A Lover’s Discourse. For a book purportedly about love, it didn’t look very romantic. The cover was a somber chocolate brown, the title turquoise. There was no author photograph and only a sketchy bio, listing Barthes’ other works.

Madeleine had the book in her lap. With her right hand she was eating peanut butter straight from the jar. The spoon fit perfectly against the curve of her upper palate, allowing the peanut butter to dissolve creamily against her tongue.

Opening to the introduction, she began to read:

The necessity for this book is to be found in the following consideration: that the lover’s discourse is today of an extreme solitude.

Outside, the temperature, which had remained cold through March, had shot up into the fifties. The resulting thaw was alarming in its suddenness, drainpipes and gutters dripping, sidewalks puddling, streets flooded, a constant sound of water rushing downhill.

Madeleine had her windows open on the liquid darkness. She sucked the spoon and read on:

What we have been able to say below about waiting, anxiety, memory is no more than a modest supplement offered to the reader to be made free with, to be added to, subtracted from, and passed on to others: around the figure, the players pass the handkerchief which sometimes, by a final parenthesis, is held a second longer before handing it on. (Ideally, the book would be a cooperative: “To the United Readers and Lovers.”)

It wasn’t only that this writing seemed beautiful to Madeleine. It wasn’t only that these opening sentences of Barthes’ made immediate sense. It wasn’t only the relief at recognizing that here, finally, was a book she might write her final paper on. What made Madeleine sit up in bed was something closer to the reason she read books in the first place and had always loved them. Here was a sign that she wasn’t alone. Here was an articulation of what she had been so far mutely feeling. In bed on a Friday night, wearing sweatpants, her hair tied back, her glasses smudged, and eating peanut butter from the jar, Madeleine was in a state of extreme solitude.

It had to do with Leonard. With how she felt about him and how she couldn’t tell anyone. With how much she liked him and how little she knew about him. With how desperately she wanted to see him and how hard it was to do so.

In recent days, from her solitude, Madeleine had sent out feelers. She talked about Semiotics 211 with her roommates, mentioning Thurston, Cassandra, and Leonard. It turned out that Abby knew Leonard from her freshman year.

“What was he like?” Madeleine asked.

“Sort of intense. Really smart, but intense. He used to call me all the time. Like every day.”

“Did he like you?”

“No, he just wanted to talk. He’d keep me on the phone for an hour.”

“What did you guys talk about?”

“Everything! His relationship. My relationship. His parents, my parents. Jimmy Carter getting attacked by that swamp rabbit, which he was obsessed about. He’d go on and on.”

“Who was he going out with?”

“Some girl named Mindy. But then they broke up. That’s when he really started calling me. He’d call like six times a day. He was always going on about how good Mindy smelled. She had this smell that was supposedly perfectly compatible to Leonard, chemically. He was worried no girl would ever smell right to him again. I told him it was probably her moisturizer. He said no, it was her skin. It was chemically perfect. That’s what he’s like.” She paused and gave Madeleine a searching look. “Why are you asking? Do you like him?”

“I just know him from class,” Madeleine said.

“Do you want me to invite him for dinner?”

“I didn’t say that.”

“I’ll invite him to dinner,” Abby said.

The dinner had been on Tuesday night, three days ago. Leonard had come politely bearing a gift, a set of dish towels. He’d dressed up, wearing a white shirt with a skinny necktie, his long hair gathered in a masculine ponytail like a Scottish warrior. He was touchingly sincere, saying hello to Abby, handing her the wrapped gift and thanking her for the invitation.

Madeleine tried not to seem overeager. At dinner, she paid attention to Brian Weeger, whose breath had a dog-food smell. A couple of times, when she looked over at Leonard, he stared back, fixedly, appearing almost upset. Later, when Madeleine was in the kitchen, rinsing dishes, Leonard came in. She turned to find him inspecting a bump on the wall.

“This must be an old gas main,” he said.

Madeleine looked at the bump, which had been painted over many times.

“They used to have gas lamps in these old places,” Leonard went on.

“They probably used to pump the gas up from the basement. If anybody’s pilot blew out, on any floor, you’d have a leak. Gas didn’t have an odor back then, either. They didn’t start adding methyl mercaptan until later.”

“Good to know,” Madeleine said.

“This place must have been a powder keg.” Leonard tapped the jutting object with his fingernail, turned, and looked Madeleine meaningfully in the face.

“I haven’t been going to class,” he said.

“I know.”

Leonard’s head was way up above her, but then he bent down, in a peaceful, leaf-eater motion, and said, “I haven’t been feeling well.”

“Were you sick?”

“I’m better now.”

In the living room Olivia called out, “Who wants some Delamain? It’s yummy!”

“I want some,” Brian Weeger said. “That stuff’s killer.”

Leonard said, “Were the dish towels all right?”

“What?”

“The dish towels. I bought you some dish towels.”

“Oh, they’re great,” Madeleine said. “They’re perfect. We’ll use them! Thank you.”

“I would have brought wine, or scotch, but that’s the kind of thing my father would do.”

“You don’t want to do anything your father would do?”

Leonard’s face and voice remained solemn as he replied, “My father is a depressive who self-medicates with alcohol. My mother is more or less the same.”

“Where do they live?”

“They’re divorced. My mother still lives in Portland, where I’m from. My dad’s in Europe. He lives in Antwerp. Last time I heard.”

This interchange was encouraging, in a way. Leonard was sharing personal information. On the other hand, the information indicated that he had a troubled relationship with his parents, who were themselves troubled, and Madeleine made a point of going out only with guys who liked their parents.

“What does your father do?” Leonard asked.

Caught off guard, Madeleine hesitated. “He used to work at a college,” she said. “He’s retired.”

“What was he? Professor?”

“He was the president.”

Leonard’s face twitched. “Oh.”

“It’s just a small college. In New Jersey. It’s called Baxter.”

Abby came in to get some glasses. Leonard helped her get them off the top shelf. When she was gone, he turned back to Madeleine and said, as if in pain, “There’s a Fellini film playing at the Cable Car this weekend. Amarcord.”

Madeleine gazed encouragingly up at him. There were all kinds of outmoded, novelistic words to describe how she was feeling, words like aflutter. But she had her rules. One rule was that the guy had to ask her out, not the other way around.

“I think it’s playing on Saturday,” Leonard said.

“This Saturday?”

“Do you like Fellini?”

To reply to this question did not, in Madeleine’s view, compromise her rule.

“You want to know something embarrassing?” she said.

“I’ve never seen a Fellini film.”

“You should see one,” Leonard said.

“I’ll call you.”

“All right.”

“Do I have your number? Oh, right, I have it. It’s the same as Abby’s number.”

“Do you want me to write it down?” Madeleine asked.

“No,” Leonard said.

“I have it.”

And he rose, brontosaurus-like, to his place among the treetops.

For the rest of the week, Madeleine stayed in every night, waiting for Leonard to call. When she came back from classes in the afternoon she interrogated her roommates to find out if he had called while she was out.

“Some guy called yesterday,” Olivia said, on Thursday. “When I was in the shower.”

“Why didn’t you tell me?”

“Sorry, I forgot.”

“Who was it?”

“He didn’t say.”

“Did it sound like Leonard?”

“I didn’t notice. I was dripping wet.”

“Thanks for taking a message!”

“Sorree,” Olivia said.

“God. It was just a two-second call. He said he’d call back later.”

And so now it was Friday night—Friday night!—and Madeleine had declined to go out with Abby and Olivia in order to stay in and wait by the phone. She was reading A Lover’s Discourse and marveling at its relevance to her life.



Waiting
attente / waiting
Tumult of anxiety provoked by waiting for the loved being, subject to trivial delays (rendezvous, letters, telephone calls, returns).
… Waiting is an enchantment: I have received orders not to move. Waiting for a telephone is thereby woven out of tiny, unavowable interdictions to infinity: I forbid myself to leave the room, to go to the toilet, even to telephone (to keep the line from being busy) …

She could hear the television going in the apartment below. Madeleine’s bedroom faced the State Capitol dome, brightly lit against the dark sky. The heat, which they couldn’t control, was still on, the radiator wastefully knocking and hissing.

The more she thought about it, the more Madeleine understood that extreme solitude didn’t just describe the way she was feeling about Leonard. It explained how she’d always felt when she was in love. It explained what love was like and, just maybe, what was wrong with it.

The telephone rang.

Madeleine sat up in bed. She dog-eared the page she was reading. She waited as long as she could (three rings) before answering.

“Hello?”

“Maddy?”

It was Alton, calling from Prettybrook.

“Oh. Hi, Daddy.”

“Don’t sound so excited.”

“I’m studying.”

In his usual way, without niceties, he got to the matter at hand. “Your mother and I were just discussing graduation plans.”

For a moment, Madeleine thought Alton meant that they were discussing her future. But then she realized it was just logistics.

“It’s April,” she said. “Graduation’s not until June.”

“My experience with college towns is that the hotels get booked up months in advance. So we have to decide what we’re doing. Now, here are the options. Are you listening?”

“Yes,” Madeleine said, and began, at that instant, to tune out. She stuck the spoon back into the peanut butter jar and brought it to her mouth, this time just licking it.

In the phone Alton’s voice was saying,

“Option one: Your mother and I come up the night before the ceremony, stay in a hotel, and we see you for dinner the night of graduation. Option two: We come up the morning of the ceremony, have breakfast with you, and then leave after the ceremony. Both proposals are acceptable to us. It’s your choice. But let me explain the pros and cons of each scenario.”

Madeleine was about to answer when Phyllida spoke up on another extension.

“Hi, dear. I hope we didn’t wake you.”

“We didn’t wake her,” Alton barked. “Eleven o’clock’s not late at college. Especially on a Friday night. Hey, what are you doing in on a Friday night? Got a pimple?”

“Hi, Mummy,” Madeleine said, ignoring him.

“Maddy, sweetie, we’re redoing your bedroom and I wanted to ask you—”

“You’re redoing my bedroom?”

“Yes, it needs freshening up. I—”

“My room?”

“Yes. I was thinking about recarpeting it in green. You know, a good green.”

“No!” Madeleine cried.

“Maddy, we’ve kept your room the way it is for four years now—you’d think it was a shrine! I’d like to be able to use it as a guest room, occasionally, because of the en suite bathroom. You can still have it when you come home, don’t worry. It’ll always be your room.”

“What about my wallpaper?”

“It’s old. It’s peeling.”

“You can’t change my wallpaper!”

“Oh, all right. I’ll leave the wallpaper alone. But the carpet—”

“Excuse me,” Alton said in a peremptory tone. “This call is about graduation. Phyl, you’re hijacking my agenda. You two sort out the redecorating some other time. Now, Maddy, let me go over the pros and cons. When your cousin graduated from Williams, we all had dinner after the ceremony. And, if you’ll remember, Doats complained the whole time that he was missing all the parties—and he left halfway through the meal. Now, your mother and I are willing to stay the night—or two nights—if we’re going to see you. But if you’re going to be busy, maybe the breakfast option makes more sense.”

“Graduation’s two months away. I don’t even know what’s happening yet.”

“That’s what I told your father,” Phyllida said.

It occurred to Madeleine that she was tying up the line.

“Let me think about it,” she said abruptly. “I have to go. I’m studying.”

“If we’re going to stay the night,” Alton repeated, “I’d like to make reservations soon.”

“Call me later. Let me think about it. Call me Sunday.”

Alton was still speaking when she hung up, so when the phone rang again, twenty seconds later,

Madeleine picked up and said,

“Daddy, stop it. We don’t have to decide tonight.”

There was silence on the line. And then a male voice said, “You don’t have to call me Daddy.”

“Oh, God. Leonard? Sorry! I thought you were my father. He’s freaking out about graduation plans already.”

“I was just having a little freak-out myself.”

“About what?”

“About calling you.”

This was good. Madeleine ran a finger along her lower lip. She said, “Have you calmed down or do you want to call back later?”

“I’m resting comfortably now, thank you.”

Madeleine waited for more. None came. “Are you calling for a reason?” she asked.

“Yes. That Fellini film? I was hoping you might, if you’re not too, I know it’s bad manners calling so late, but I was at the lab.”

Leonard did sound a little nervous. That wasn’t good. Madeleine didn’t like nervous guys. Nervous guys were nervous for a reason. Up until now Leonard had seemed more the tortured type than the nervous type. Tortured was better.

“I don’t think that was a complete sentence,” she said.

“What did I leave out?” Leonard asked.

“How about, ‘Would you like to come with me?’”

“I’d be happy to,” Leonard said.

Madeleine frowned into the receiver. She had a feeling that Leonard had set up this exchange, like a chess player thinking eight moves ahead. She was going to complain when Leonard said, “Sorry. Not funny.” He comically cleared his throat. “Listen, would you like to go to the movies with me?”

She didn’t answer right away. He deserved a little punishment. And so she put the screws to him—for another three seconds.

“I’d love to.”

And there it was already, that word. She wondered if Leonard had noticed. She wondered what it meant that she had noticed. It was just a word, after all. A way of speaking.

The next night, Saturday, the fickle weather turned cold again. Madeleine was chilled in her brown suede jacket as she walked to the restaurant where they’d agreed to meet. Afterward, they made their way to the Cable Car and found a sagging couch among the other mismatched sofas and armchairs that furnished the art-house cinema.

She had a hard time following the movie. The narrative cues weren’t as crisp as those of Hollywood, and the film had a dream-like quality, lush but discontinuous. The audience, being a college audience, laughed knowingly during the risqué European moments: when the huge-titted woman stuffed her huge tit into the young hero’s mouth; or when the old man up in the tree cried out, “I want a woman!” Fellini’s theme appeared to be the same as Roland Barthes’—love—but here it was Italian and all about the body instead of French and all about the mind. She wondered if Leonard had known what Amarcord was going to be about. She wondered if it was his way of getting her in the mood. As it so happened, she was in the mood, but no thanks to the movie. The movie was pretty to look at but confused her and made her feel naïve and suburban. It seemed both overly indulgent and overly male.

After it was over, they made their way out onto South Main. They had no stated destination. Madeleine was pleased to realize that Leonard, though tall, wasn’t too tall. If she wore heels, the top of her head came up higher than his shoulders, almost to his chin.

“What did you think?” he said.

“Well, at least now I know what Felliniesque is.”

The downtown skyline was on their left, across the river, the spire of the Superman building visible against the unnaturally pink city sky. The streets were empty except for other people leaving the cinema.

“My goal in life is to become an adjective,” Leonard said. “People would go around saying, ‘That was so Bankheadian.’ Or, ‘A little too Bankheadian for my taste.’”

“Bankheadian has a ring,” Madeleine said.

“It’s better than Bankheadesque.”

“Or Bankheadish.”

“Ish is terrible all around. There’s Joycean, Shakespearean, Faulknerian. But ish? Who is there who’s an ish?”

“Thomas Mannish?”

“Kafkaesque,” Leonard said. “Pynchonesque! See, Pynchon’s already an adjective. Gaddis. What would Gaddis be? Gaddisesque? Gaddisy?”

“You can’t really do it with Gaddis,” Madeleine said.

“Yeah,” Leonard said. “Tough luck for Gaddis. Do you like him?”

“I read a little of The Recognitions,” Madeleine said.

They turned up Planet Street, climbing the slope.

“Bellovian,” Leonard said. “It’s extra nice when they change the spelling slightly. Nabokovian already has the v. So does Chekhovian. The Russians have it made. Tolstoyan! That guy was an adjective waiting to happen.”

“Don’t forget Tolstoyanism,” Madeleine said.

“My God!” Leonard said. “A noun! I’ve never even dreamed of being a noun.”

“What would Bankheadian mean?”

Leonard thought for a second. “‘Of or related to Leonard Bankhead (American, born 1959), characterized by excessive introspection or worry. Gloomy, depressive. See basket case.’”

Madeleine was laughing. Leonard stopped walking and took hold of her arm, looking at her seriously.

“I’m taking you to my place,” he said.

“What?”

“All this time we’ve been walking? I’ve been leading you back to my place. This is how I do it, apparently. It’s shameful. Shameful. I don’t want it to be like that. Not with you. So I’m telling you.”

“I figured we were going back to your place.”

“You did?”

“I was going to call you on it. When we got closer.”

“We’re already close.”

“I can’t come up.”

“Please.”

“No. Not tonight.”

“Hannaesque,” Leonard said. “Stubborn. Given to ironclad positions.”

“Hannarian,” Madeleine said. “Dangerous. Not to be messed with.”

“I stand warned.”

They stood looking at each other on cold, dark Planet Street. Leonard took his hands out of his pockets to tuck his long hair behind his ears.

“Maybe I’ll come up just for a minute,” Madeleine said.



“Special Days”
fête / festivity
The amorous subject experiences every meeting
with the loved being as a festival.
1. The Festivity is what is waited for, what is expected. What I expect of the promised presence is an unheard-of totality of pleasures, a banquet; I rejoice like the child laughing at the sight of the mother whose mere presence heralds and signifies a plenitude of satisfactions: I am about to have before me, and for myself, the “source of all good things.”
“I am living through days as happy as those God keeps for his chosen people; and whatever becomes of me, I can never say that I have not tasted the purest joys of life.”

It was debatable whether or not Madeleine had fallen in love with Leonard the first moment she’d seen him. She hadn’t even known him then, and so what she’d felt was only sexual attraction, not love. Even after they’d gone out for coffee, she couldn’t say that what she was feeling was anything more than infatuation. But ever since the night when they went back to Leonard’s place after watching Amarcordand started fooling around, when Madeleine found that instead of being turned off by physical stuff, the way she often was with boys, instead of putting up with that or trying to overlook it, she’d spent the entire night worrying that she was turning Leonard off, worrying that her body wasn’t good enough, or that her breath was bad from the Caesar salad she’d unwisely ordered at dinner; worrying, too, about having suggested they order martinis because of the way Leonard had sarcastically said,

“Sure. Martinis. We can pretend we’re Salinger characters”; after having had, as a consequence of all this anxiety, pretty much no sexual pleasure, despite the perfectly respectable session they’d put together; and after Leonard (like every guy) had immediately fallen asleep, leaving her to lie awake stroking his head and vaguely hoping she didn’t get a urinary tract infection, Madeleine asked herself if the fact that she’d just spent the whole night worrying wasn’t, in fact, a surefire sign that she was falling in love. And certainly after they’d spent the next three days at Leonard’s place having sex and eating pizza, after she’d relaxed enough to be able to come at least once in a while and finally to stop worrying so much about having an orgasm because her hunger for Leonard was in some way satisfied by his satisfaction, after she’d allowed herself to sit naked on his gross couch and to walk to the bathroom knowing he was staring at her (imperfect) ass, to root for food in his disgusting refrigerator, to read the brilliant half-page of philosophy paper sticking up out of his typewriter, and to hear him pee with taurine force into the toilet bowl, certainly, by the end of those three days, Madeleine knew she was in love.

But that didn’t mean she had to tell anyone. Especially Leonard.

Leonard Bankhead had a studio apartment on the third floor of a low-rent student building. The halls were full of bikes and junk mail. Stickers decorated the other tenants’ doors: a fluorescent marijuana leaf, a silk-screen Blondie. Leonard’s door, however, was as blank as the apartment inside. In the middle of the room, a twin mattress lay beside a plastic milk crate supporting a reading lamp. There was no desk, no bookcase, not even a table, only the nasty couch, with a typewriter on another milk crate in front of it. There was nothing on the walls but bits of masking tape and, in one corner, a small portrait of Leonard, done in pencil. The drawing showed Leonard as George Washington, wearing a tricorne hat and sheltering under a blanket at Valley Forge. The caption read:

“You go. I like it here.”

Madeleine thought the handwriting looked feminine.

A ficus tree endured in the corner. Leonard moved it into the sun whenever he remembered to. Madeleine, taking pity on the tree, began to water it, until she caught Leonard looking at her one day, his eyes narrowed with suspicion.

“What?” she said.

“Nothing.”

“Come on. What?”

“You’re watering my tree.”

“The soil’s dry.”

“You’re taking care of my tree.”

She stopped doing it after that.

There was a tiny kitchen where Leonard brewed and reheated the gallon of coffee he drank every day. A big greasy wok sat on the stove. The most Leonard did in the way of preparing a meal, however, was to pour Grape Nuts into the wok. With raisins. Raisins satisfied his fruit requirement.

The apartment had a message. The message said: I am an orphan. Abby and Olivia asked Madeleine what she and Leonard did together and she never had an answer. They didn’t do<!--?i--> anything. She came to his apartment and they lay down on the mattress and Leonard asked her how she was doing, really wanting to know.

What did they do? She talked; he listened; then he talked and she listened. She’d never met anyone, and certainly not a guy, who was so receptive, who took everything in. She guessed that Leonard’s shrink-like manner came from years of seeing shrinks himself, and though another of her rules was to never date guys who went to shrinks, Madeleine began to reconsider this prohibition. Back home, she and her sister had a phrase for serious emotional talks. They called it “having a heavy.” If a boy approached during one, the girls would look up and give warning:

“We’re having a heavy.” And the boy would retreat. Until it was over. Until the heavy had passed.

Going out with Leonard was like having a heavy all the time. Whenever she was with him, Leonard gave her his full attention. He didn’t stare into her eyes or smother her the way Billy had, but he made it clear he was available. He offered little advice. Only listened, and murmured, reassuringly.

People often fell in love with their shrinks, didn’t they? That was called transference and was to be avoided. But what if you were already sleeping with your shrink? What if your shrink’s couch was already a bed?

And plus it wasn’t all heavy, the heavies. Leonard was funny. He told hilarious stories in a deadpan voice. His head sank into his shoulders, his eyes filled with rue, as his sentences drawled on. “Did I ever tell you I play an instrument? The summer my parents got divorced, they sent me to live with my grandparents in Buffalo. The people next door were Latvian, the Bruverises. And they both played the kokle.

Do you know what a kokle is?

It’s sort of like a zither, but Latvian.

“Anyway, I used to hear Mr. and Mrs. Bruveris playing their kokles over in the next yard. It was an amazing sound. Sort of wild and over-stimulated on the one hand, but melancholy on the other. The kokle is the manic-depressive of the string family. Anyway, I was bored to death that summer. I was sixteen. Six foot one. One hundred and thirty-eight pounds. A major reefer smoker. I used to get high in my bedroom and blow the smoke out the window, and then I’d go out to the porch and listen to the Bruverises playing next door. Sometimes other people came over. Other kokle players. They set up lawn chairs in the backyard and they’d all sit there playing together. It was an orchestra! A kokle orchestra. Then one day they saw me watching and invited me over. They gave me potato salad and a grape Popsicle and I asked Mr. Bruveris how you played a kokle and he started giving me lessons. I used to go over there every day. They had an old kokle they let me borrow. I used to practice five, six hours a day. I was into it.

“At the end of that summer, when I had to leave, the Bruverises gave me the kokle. To keep. I took it on the plane with me. I got a separate seat for it, like I was Rostropovich. My father had moved out of the house by then. So it was just me, my sister, and my mother. And I kept on practicing. I got good enough that I joined this band. We used to play at ethnic festivals and Orthodox weddings. We had these traditional costumes, embroidered vests, puffy sleeves, knee-high boots. Me and all the adults. Most of them were Latvian, some Russians, too. Our big number was ‘Otchi Tchornyia.’ That’s the only thing that saved me in high school. The kokle.”

“Do you still play?”

“Hell no. Are you kidding? The kokle?”

Listening to Leonard, Madeleine felt impoverished by her happy childhood. She never wondered why she acted the way she did, or what effect her parents had had on her personality. Being fortunate had dulled her powers of observation. Whereas Leonard noticed every little thing. For instance, they spent a weekend on Cape Cod (partly to visit Pilgrim Lake Laboratory, where Leonard was applying for a research fellowship), and as they were driving back, Leonard said, “What do you do? Just hold it?”

“What?”

“You just hold it. For two days. Until you get back home.”

As his meaning seeped in, she said, “I can’t believe you!”

“You have never, ever, taken a dump in my presence.”

“In your presence?”

“When I am present. Or nearby.”

“What’s wrong with that?”

“What’s wrong with it? Nothing. If you’re talking about I-sleep-over-and-go-off-to-class-the-next-morning and then you go and take a dump, that’s understandable. But when we spend two, almost three days together, eating surf and turf, and you do not take a dump the entire time, I can only conclude that you are more than a little anal.”

“So what? It’s embarrassing!” Madeleine said.

“O.K.? I find it embarrassing.”

Leonard stared at her without expression and said, “Do you mind when I take a dump?”

“Do we have to talk about this? It’s sort of gross.”

“I think we do need to talk about it. Because you’re obviously not very relaxed around me, and I am—or thought I was—your boyfriend, and that means—or should mean—that I’m the person you’re most relaxed around. Leonard equals maximum relaxation.”

Guys weren’t supposed to be the talkers. Guys weren’t supposed to get you to open up. But this guy was; this guy did. He’d said he was her “boyfriend,” too. He’d made it official.

“I’ll try to be more relaxed,” Madeleine said, “if it’ll make you happy. But in terms of—excretion—don’t get your hopes up.”

“This isn’t for me,” Leonard said. “This is for Mr. Lower Intestine. This is for Mr. Duodenum.”

Even though this kind of amateur therapy didn’t exactly work (after that last conversation, for instance, Madeleine had more, not less, trouble going Number 2 if Leonard was within a mile), it affected Madeleine deeply. Leonard was examining her closely. She felt handled in the right way, like something precious or immensely fascinating. It made her happy to think about how much he thought about her.

By the end of April, Madeleine and Leonard had gotten into a routine of spending every night together. On weeknights, after Madeleine finished studying, she headed over to the biology lab, where she’d find Leonard staring at slides with two Chinese grad students. After she finally got Leonard to leave the lab, Madeleine then had to cajole him into sleeping at her place. At first, Leonard had liked staying at the Narragansett. He liked the ornate moldings and the view from her bedroom. He charmed Olivia and Abby by making pancakes on Sunday mornings. But soon Leonard began to complain that they always stayed at Madeleine’s place and that he never got to wake up in his own bed. Staying at Leonard’s place, however, required Madeleine to bring a fresh set of clothes each night, and since he didn’t like her to leave clothes at his place (and, to be honest, she didn’t like to, either, because whatever she left picked up a fusty smell), Madeleine had to carry her dirty clothes around to classes all day. She preferred sleeping at her own apartment, where she could use her own shampoo, conditioner, and loofah, and where it was “clean-sheet day” every Wednesday. Leonard never changed his sheets. They were a disturbing gray color. Dust balls clung to the edges of the mattress. One morning, Madeleine was horrified to see a calligraphic smear of blood that had leaked from her three weeks earlier, a stain she’d attacked with a kitchen sponge while Leonard was sleeping.

“You never wash your sheets!” she complained.

“I wash them,” Leonard said evenly.

“How often?”

“When they get dirty.”

“They’re always dirty.”

“Not everyone can drop off their laundry at the cleaners every week. Not everybody grew up with ‘clean-sheet day.’”

“You don’t have to drop them off,” Madeleine said, undeterred. “You’ve got a washer in the basement.”

“I use the washer,” Leonard said. “Just not every Wednesday. I don’t equate dirt with death and decay.”

“Oh, and I do? I’m obsessed with death because I wash my sheets?”

“People’s attitudes to cleanliness have a lot to do with their fear of death.”

“This isn’t about death, Leonard. This is about crumbs in the bed. This is about the fact that your pillow smells like a liverwurst sandwich.”

“Wrong.”

“It does!”

“Wrong.”

“Smell it, Leonard!”

“It’s salami. I don’t like liverwurst.”

To a certain extent, this kind of arguing was fun. But then came nights when Madeleine forgot to pack a change of clothes and Leonard accused her of doing this on purpose in order to force him to sleep at her place. Next, more worryingly, came nights when Leonard said he was going home to study and would see her tomorrow. He began pulling all-nighters. One of his philosophy professors offered Leonard the use of his cabin in the Berkshires and, for an entire rainy weekend, Leonard went there, alone, to write a paper on Fichte, returning with a typescript 123 pages long and wearing a bright orange hunter’s vest. The vest became his favorite item of clothing. He wore it all the time.

He started finishing Madeleine’s sentences. As if her mind was too slow. As if he couldn’t wait for her to gather her thoughts. He riffed on the things she said, going off on strange tangents, making puns. Whenever she told him he needed to get some sleep, he got angry and didn’t call her for days. And it was during this period that Madeleine fully understood how the lover’s discourse was of an extreme solitude. The solitude was extreme because it wasn’t physical. It was extreme because you felt it while in the company of the person you loved. It was extreme because it was in your head, that most solitary of places.

The more Leonard pulled away, the more anxious Madeleine became. The more desperate she became, the more Leonard pulled away. She told herself to act cool. She went to the library to work on her marriage-plot thesis, but the sex-fantasy atmosphere—the reading-room eye contact, the beckoning stacks—made her desperate to see Leonard. And so against her will her feet began leading her back across campus through the darkness to the biology department. Up to the last moment, Madeleine had the crazy hope that this expression of weakness might in fact be strength. It was a brilliant strategy because it lacked all strategy. It involved no games, only sincerity. Seeing such sincerity, how could Leonard fail to respond? She was almost happy as she came up behind the lab table and tapped Leonard on the shoulder, and her happiness lasted until he turned around with a look not of love but of annoyance.

It didn’t help that it was spring. Every day, people seemed more and more unclothed. The magnolia trees, budding on the green, looked positively enflamed. They sent out a perfume that drifted through the windows of Semiotics 211. The magnolia trees hadn’t read Roland Barthes. They didn’t think love was a mental state; the magnolias insisted it was natural, perennial.

On a beautiful warm May day, Madeleine showered, shaved her legs with extra care, and put on her first spring dress: an apple-green baby-doll dress with a bib collar and a high hem. With this, she wore Buster Browns, cream and rust, and went sockless. Her bare legs, toned from a winter of squash-playing, were pale but smooth. She kept her glasses on, left her hair loose, and walked over to Leonard’s apartment on Planet Street. On the way, she stopped at a market to buy a hunk of cheese, some Stoned Wheat Thins, and a bottle of Valpolicella. Coming down the hill from Benefit toward South Main, she felt the warm breeze between her thighs. The front door of Leonard’s building was propped open with a brick, so she went up to his apartment and knocked. Leonard opened the door. He looked like he’d been napping.

“Niiiiice dress,” he said.

They never made it to the park. They picnicked on each other. As Leonard pulled her toward the mattress, Madeleine dropped her packages, hoping the wine bottle didn’t break. She slipped her dress over her head. Soon they were naked, raiding, it felt like, a huge basket of goodies. Madeleine lay on her stomach, her side, her back, nibbling all the treats, the nice-smelling fruit candies, the meaty drumsticks, as well as more sophisticated offerings, the biscotti flavored with anise, the wrinkly truffles, the salty spoonfuls of olive tapenade. She’d never been so busy in her life. At the same time, she felt strangely displaced, not quite her usual tidy ego but merged with Leonard into a great big protoplasmic, ecstatic thing. She thought she’d been in love before. She knew she’d had sex before. But all those torrid adolescent gropings, all those awkward backseat romps, the meaningful, performative summer nights with her high school boyfriend Jim McManus, even the tender sessions with Billy where he insisted they look into each other’s eyes as they came—none of that prepared her for the wallop, the all-consuming pleasure, of this.

Leonard was kissing her. When she could bear no more, Madeleine grabbed him savagely by his ears. She pulled Leonard’s head away and held it still to show him the evidence of how she felt (she was crying now). In a hoarse voice edged with something else, a sense of peril, Madeleine said, “I love you.”

Leonard stared back at her. His eyebrows twitched. Suddenly, he rolled sideways off the mattress. He stood up and walked, naked, across the room. Crouching, he reached into her bag and pulled out A Lover’s Discourse, from the pocket where she always kept it. He flipped the pages until he found the one he wanted. Then he returned to the bed and handed the book to her.

I Love You
je-t’aime / I-love-you

As she read these words, Madeleine was flooded with happiness. She glanced up at Leonard, smiling. With his finger he motioned for her to keep going. The figure refers not to the declaration of love, to the avowal, but to the repeated utterance of the love cry.<!--?i--> Suddenly Madeleine’s happiness diminished, usurped by the feeling of peril. She wished she weren’t naked. She narrowed her shoulders and covered herself with the bedsheet as she obediently read on.

Once the first avowal has been made, “I love you"" has no meaning whatever …

Leonard, squatting, had a smirk on his face.

It was then that Madeleine threw the book at his head."

Korn,Start The Healing,rap,"Do you really wanna come with me?
It's hard to see from the eyes of a stranger
Are you ready for the fear to leave
So that you can breathe and not live with the danger?


But there's always something fighting its way back in
But there's always something pushing me to give in
Do you really wanna make believe
And try to achieve a little break from the anger?


I should've been good, I should've been down
I couldn't let go, what could I do?
(I can take it all away, the feelings)

Seven-T,What If,rap,"Hope is coming down on my soul, hit right between my eyes
Said lose the dreams of my future, held back by the tears of pride

A change is walking into my life
Right in step next to my man, ooh

After all the hell that I've been through
I finally see what God has planned

What if that woman hadn't stepped on your heart
And given you love instead of misery, ooh
And what if he had given more thought and made it easier
Easier on me

If it's been left in my hands, then I wouldn't be in yours
Anybody, God, open the window, everybody slammed the door

Crazy Boy,In the Shade,rap,"He was a child of the 80's
Used to bat his eyelashes smile at the ladies
Sit a _ round single file like a crazy
Boy with a small frame parents called him lazy
Used to entertain himself his drawings were amazing
Come up in the backyard trees for a gazing
At the skies over Echo Park a live education
Gunshots blazin he would hide in his _
Called imagination he would rise to occasion
When it involved his interest and pride with no patience
Kid couldn't wait used to steal what he wanted
Learned Karma quick he could feel when he fronted
Didn't feel good but he wanted to part of
Didn't know behavior like this would be the start of
Low self-esteem and a dream deferred
Started makin stories didn't mean the word
Writing became the art that he preferred
He liked to assemble manipulate verbs
He was shy and sprung
Got took advantage of and didn't mind once
Just a little boy feelin hurt like a man
Played like a toy violin in her hand
Mom used to take him to buy them some gifts
Never once got him a kiss on the lips
Homie got smashed on the floor when they dissed
He liked girls young and he didn't know why
Couldn't know himself yet couldn't even try...
You might also likeTeenager of the 90's
Talent getting bigger but self-esteem tiny
Found himself a little, squad or brigade
Odd man out on the quad in the shade
Started growin dreads cause he wanted to be different
Didn't give a shit about the classes he was missin
Sprung on a bad girl tension on a mission
Life in peril on the path of addiction
Started smokin cigarettes and weed out in _
Walkman bumpin didn't think he needed to listen
To the teachers who gave him a ride home after school
Tried to talk to him he was actin like a fool
Wanted to be cool didn't want to be a mule
All around wuss gettin told what to do
Stupid young dude with his nuts in a vice
Ended up having death threats on his life
Fuckin homies girlfriends never felt worse
So he dropped out of school started drinkin and at first
It was fun felt good he was brave writed fast
Rapped on a crew in a cabin in a path
Livin in a studio not makin any cash
Mom kicked him out straight dumped on his ass
Smoking weed all day 16 on a fast
Track to the grave couldn't know himself yet
Now it's 96
Started puttin acid on his tongue to take a trip
Made his first tape home made made a trip
Was the hustle he was taught by his homies on the strip
Telegraph laugh had a vibe you could feel
Long island iced teas to survive with the steel
In his hand on the stage he was scared to be real
_ with a page he would hide on the field
On the stage no yield
Started poppin ecstasy beginning of the pills
Killin of his energy it mentally appealed
They were all experimenting but he thought he was healed
Travelin the world in and out of any girl
Livin like a rockstar at home he would curl
In a ball on the floor could he fall any further
Hell yeah heroin called and he heard emmm
Now he didn't give a fuck
Wasn't makin music cause he didn't give a fuck
Had to get a fix or his body would be stuck
More than down on his luck to the drug he was enslaved
Didn't give a damn what his friends say
Wanted to be done so he bowed to the sensai
Surrendering rendering faith
Found himself a program to pay for the dates
Did his first show that was free of the drank
Felt so proud self-esteem in the tank
3 years later putted music in the bank
Tryin to make due for the god that he thanks
Went through hell and he didn't know why
Couldn't know himself yet now he's gonna try.."
CYNE,400 Years,rap,"I'm passing God's conception
Approaching near the land deception
Adjust the mirror, in my rearview I see reflection
At times my highways lead to bleak direction
So I seek confession speaking to beats
I call it resurrection cause I got my soul back
Some call me pro black
Really I'm just playing my part I could've sold crack
It's not for me
My old man thought of prophecy
Kwame Nkrumah's vision live in my odyssey for real
But not your Homer in Greek mythology
Akin devise schemes to conquer this trickology
The time is now to forsake the faking
I'm freedom in the making
God's kitchen chef rock a frigid apron


Ayo, For 400 years we shed tears
And when it's death among peers we pour beers
But now what?
Look what the world made me, enslaved me
But at the end what the fuck is gonna save me?


My pulse quickening as my heart became a simile
I drift into the reaches of self, I felt panicky
Hoping for anarchy, liberation from this insanity
Tears running down my cheek hit the canopy
Wall of self doubt, shout scream and wail
At the pain coursing through my being I'm in a hell of thought
Caught between a rock and hard place
My personal space violated catching a case
I can even taste the bittersweet smell of defeat
I’m feeling the heat of blood running down in the street
Then look where I stand
My shadow is the trace of a man
That endured the hardships, formulating a plan

And tarnishing our soul
Trading our worth for platinum and gold
Our souls are undersold, for what?
Semiprecious pieces of metal value changing with time

Dear Father, I worked hard
Left places with some scars

Knew that I would rise above skies
No one was there when I cried
I was always there for my guys
I stood tall, I ain't never hide
When they call my phone, I was ready to slide


Love my sister, I love her 'til my dying days
I'm on business, bitch, but I'll still go back to my slimy ways
All I had was pennies, I got this shit out the harder way
I been high as hell, you just can't see my eyes through the Cartiers
I ain't never wanna be cool
Back when I was in school
I ain't really give a fuck 'bout school
I just do what the fuck I do
In my mind, I knew I ain't need it
I knew I was gon' do some other shit
I get on the mic, made another hit, made another hit, and another hit
Once I figured it out, it was subtle, bitch
I knew I was gon' be the one in this
I knew I was gon' be the best at this
The one and the only, bitch
The one of one, the only, bitch

Front flips and back flips, making a commotion
I know how to move around, I’ve got that locomotion
Up and down and up and down

Inflatable bounce house, tall like a lighthouse

And I get a million dollars like Donald Trump

So hard to resist she looks like a model
Waddle waddle to the very next day
Make her feel like she was in fifty shades of grey
I’ve got that swag money but she doesn’t wanna pay
Gonna have to take revenge and make her sway

They  would have held their own but I got the work
Flowing off the top baby, you see I get this work
I'm 19 years old, you know what I'm saying when I cock with the flow
I ain't gotta force shit, I will never forfeit
I graduated Valedictorian with a fucking 4.6
Not bragging, I'm expressing intellect
And elucidating complexities of my sentences
And I'm willing to bet like Nepal
That with my metaphors, like McCartney, will leave you appalled
But I'm chilling though
You do one thing wrong and they see you as the fucking villain, though
But I try to be vilified like 2Pac, I ride til I die, I ride til I die
All I need in this life of sin is me, my notebook and my fucking pen and a grin


You might also likeLost a couple friends, but I'm not caring though
Cuz six Magikarp equals six Gyarados
You gotta be patient like a doctor office
Then I smoke that weed, like Weezing got me Koffing
Like the Pokemon, you know he strong
When I'm flowing off the top, you know I'm gone
But I spit the best metaphors and I do
Magician, magic like I am Dumbledore with my metaphors
I don't care cuz my intellect is strong, you know what I mean
I got you bodied, bomb it like Gaddafi
Flowing off the top, got a code like Hammurabi
Cuz an eye for an eye, but all these niggas blind
You see me, off the top I am outta my mind
Cuz I got a lot of stuff going but I will go very strong
I am reminiscent of my past days, my cousin gotta baby now
That nigga's name is Vincent, he's the little homie
He is growing to be a man and what I teach, he will be bigger
And again I respect them, I respect my pen
I respect my family, got a beer in my hand right now
It's a Pabst Blue Ribbon for participation
I'm just playing, I'm not waiting for my chance to blow
Play it like pianos, sewing off top get you hotter than a flannel
Going to war because our shorts  in the camo
I don't even know, go harder than enamel"
Tink,Million,rap,"Your love is a one in a million

You can be the man I marry
We can have this for a very

Schlish,Tough,rap,"(Verse 1)
Drippin' with the wave, lil Kourtney in the place

Black Deniro,Nothing to Lose,rap,"Yeah you heard what he said I'm on a fucking paper route
Quick to take a neighbor out, .40 with the laser out
You niggas eating just to having a feast
My niggas wilding out, catching hommies stabbing police
Cash rule everything around me, everything I see
Everything I touch, robbery's a must
You niggas all blinging, 24's on the Lincoln
Waist-length mink until you boys all stinking
Wrapped in that trash bag, Hefty or the Glad bag
'Iladel niggas, bombs over Baghdad
I'm in ya' new trees, Hummers and V's
23's when I breeze, hundred thou' on my sleeve
40 on my neck, keep the 40 in the Lex'
You drink a lot? Well here, take this .40 to the neck
You marry shorty, I fuck with shorty for the sex
You fuck with shorty for the face I fuck with shorty for the neck
I'm quick to grip a bi chick, tell her leave them dykes alone
Won't you become a rapper boo, spit up on this microphone
Young version of Al Capone, I'm crowned, I claim my throne
A hundred niggas crowd in ya' home
Dirty birds in they hand, 30 birds in the van
Ya' homie set it up, you got a nerve, that's ya' man?
He gave me the inside scoop on where to find the grams
Under the kitchen sink behind the pots and the pans

For the second time on the mixtape y'all dudes better duck fast
'Cause every time I spit my shit louder than a gun blast
I want cash and I want it with the quick-fast
And if not, you bitches get peeled, like old scabs
Trigga vicious when it come to this rhyme bout
But think not, and get ya' cookies tooken like a Girl Scout
You Girl Scouts better knuckle up
'Cause I got box game like seatbelts, most niggas buckle up
And I supply the fiends
And I smoke weed smoke seed and my weed green like Listerine
Ain't no enticing me
But keep talking and get you guys' throats cut from swallowing teeth
And I like burners 'cause they red-hot and blow
You bitches, like burners grab cock and blow
Probably get some new Timbs, already leaning 'em
Nigga talk shit get beat with a Swiss Premium
Even if ya' man's is up, and they posted in the spot
Let them  go close to that bedrock
Rock-a-bye baby
Yo this is my time, you 'bout to get put to sleep, like a nursery rhyme
I'm hot as a nine
Dog I'll split ya' cabbage
And leave four shots in ya' chest like, Philly off the Mavericks
So pussy keep talking hands
So I can cut ya' feet off, now try and kick my ass
It's Trigga nigga and I'm taking it home
You fags like knick-knack paddywhack
You dogs get boned
And beforehand, I made a large bet on my team
And I'ma win and see paper like a fax machine
I'm stacking green, man this shit a place-your-bet
I run with the heavy hitters in the 'burg, you run with the rest

You can see the bitch in a nigga when the pump in his mouth
Kill a whole fucking family then pump in the house
Wipe the fingerprints off, throw the pump on the couch
Whatever's left in the handguns I'm pumping 'em out
I'm a mobster, something like, Robert De Niro
And you can get, robbed for dinero, lie with the heroes
Niggas always claiming they all tough
Till they get cracked with the gat and ya' skull bust
It's war son, and I ain't got nothing to lose, it's you and me
You know Reed smooth dude just doing me
I love my family I love my niggas
Love my weed I love my trigger, so I can bust off
I love my paper I love you haters but, ain't no more room on my dick so jump the fuck off
.40 cal turn ya' brains into duck sauce
Aim let it dump off, hollows knock chumps off
Let the jammy blam, tools like a handyman
If you play the family man, spray up the family van
 like , say my name and I appear like Candyman
I advise you to stay in ya' lane boss
The age of 13, I was up in a range dog
Not the one you drive, the one that's danger
Target ya' face to release my anger
Black skully black gloves, Dickies from last year
Your crib jackpot, I smell it the cash here
The Benz got 23's, TVs and glass chairs
I was on the block ripping, you was a cashier
Working up at Save-A-Lot, working hard, save a lot
I was on a crazy block knocking off crazy rocks

The youngest nigga on my squad but, sky's the limit
When the beef's on the heat's drawn eyes be tinted
All these guys like 'Trigga clocking'
But let a nigga try to rob me, hang him up, by his motherfucking Dickie pockets
On the block, like a nigga gon' shake and bake
But in the kitchen be the nigga with a paper plate
You can hate, but Trig' gon' stay the top
And stay my post, and I ain't talking 'bout the cereal box
You punks, my pumps put people in places places for people
Need not finish the statement
Squash beef I won't, but you can ask me 'do
How you hustle when you ask for dough?
Smirk when you walk past me yo
The MAC jerk disperse insert bullets till ya' fucking chest hurt
You might as well label me the don specially when I'm high
Red-eyed in hydro and a bong
And a TEC just as long as my arm to get the cash
Treat dudes like cars, stick shift they ass
Push his head forward, let him taste the dash
Leave him slumped, 'fore a faggot come and rape his ass
Hit me up  I leave niggas stuffed with bullets
Like how, Taco Bell stuff beef in tacos
And I'm known to blow shows with Rugers
And hit, niggas Medullas, and they stop, any nigga from shooting


I spit for my niggas that be feeling my pain
That's on the grind like me I know you feeling the same
Had to post on that wall wit' ya' pack in ya' balls
And stash the coke, hide the grass in them cracks in the wall
Niggas love when I come around, chicks yeah I fuck 'em down
I ain't talkin Neef young buck but I'll buck ya' down
Southwest membership, sign up
You a gangsta or a bitch nigga make ya' mind up
You know whatever I got, on the block, or the studio
Wherever I go nigga I roll with the toolie 'do
This Reed Dollaz and this my year
Now listen here, I move like I'm switching gears
Musical without the switching of chairs
If you ain't in my circle oh, best believe I had to switch up my peers
Get away from all the drama in there
Stand alone cannons blow, blew steel with the Talons in there
And I can switch it up, rip it up, stick shift, shift it up
My shotty like a school bus nigga, I had to pick it up
And you don't wanna see Reed in the zone
You fuck around and find Reed, in the back of ya' home
Wit' a bookbag, war paint, vestses and ammo
K over the shoulder two Berettas I'm Rambo
 flow
Before I put ya' knowledge all over that Land Ro'


I'm Trigga some  from the  and I rep cuz
And you other niggas is faggots who suck dick for drugs
I'm sick of watching you bitches
You foul mouth-ass snitches
Who tricking and should be dealt with with heart
This run'll feel 'em I say, claim the day and the other is just a memory
Proclaim me the hottest to ever enter this industry
Get, stuck in a waistline, philly tucked in a tool sock
Niggas don't get the punchline
Let the fucking beat drop since chickens is what I'm picking and paper is what I'm getting
And coke, is what I'm flipping
That hard, white in the kitchen
My dirty bird fucking sickly with chrome and ivory handle
It bust, and leave you faceless laying in fucking shambles
Remember the name bitch, the one, who tote the fifth in the hood
This nigga's prick and he off
Can suck a dick and it's crazy watching you ladies and niggas who making plenty
I blast, you with the semi and dare you to ask for sympathy
Stop, using these TECs
'Cause they just, like oral sex
When they blow, feels like I'm coming start shaking just like Tourette's
Believe when that hand jerk, I take it back to the basics
With hot lead, and when they spray they kill those-"
Joe Blow,Been Through so Much,rap,"Feel like I have dated every woman in the world
Most were beautiful
Some were corporate
Worked in a little cubicle
I done some shit to some that I would never do to you
Cause some were tailor made but still wasn't suitable
Come to yours I see why you be elusive
Some took advantage off you, some were intrusive
Some put they hands on you, some were abusive
Most cheated on you must they think you were exclusive
Ain't gotta say a word, I already know it
Even if you scared to death it's ill that you never show it
I go to sleep with fear of losing you, don't wanna blow it
And I wouldn't be surprised if I did, that's typical Joe shit
I lie forever
Not only do she trust me, her body is a work of art
There's a beauty in every ugly
So for me as a friend though our past is so horrible
Together we'll never have to see em' again
I love you


You and I, you and I seem crazy
I would die, if you leave my life baby
No one else gave a damn 'bout us
Where we go, I don't know the future
I just know, I don't wanna lose ya

I've been with every woman in this world, except a virgin chick
Some kept my soul alive just so they can murder it
We're both broken pieces, both been hurt and shit
Both took a chance on each other and it was worth the risk
She low maintenance but she deserves a grip
Give her the best of me cause she endured the worst of it
She been through so much, still she carry on
So if she comes with baggage, it's a carry-on
So in life without, I couldn't conceive
I tried to dump her one time, but she wouldn't leave
And I ain't want her to, so that was good to see
Soon as I uttered the word I damn near couldn't breathe
Been trough the run around, took her off the carousel
Still in shock that her passion's unparalleled
I know some exes must be mad as hell
But we were so broken down, we had to gel
I love you


You and I, you and I seem crazy
I would die, if you leave my life baby
No one else gave a damn 'bout us
Where we go, I don't know the future
I just know, I don't wanna lose ya
We just taking our chance on love, on love

I've been with every type of woman, some of the baddest ones
Some were cougars, but still they acted young
Some were gossip queens, but I ain't mad at them
You make bittersweet, today that shit matters none
Some I knew wouldn't last when that crash begun
Some played it cool, but wasn't half as fun
Some ain't over me, they just blame away
Some I ruined myself, others came that way
Some were modelesque, left, started gaining weight
Other waited to gain, but met the same fate
Some moved to the city for a change of pace
Some I never broke up with, just let it fade away
Some never witnessed love, don't know what we see in it
Was a stranger for you, so it's ill how you believe in it
Cause you done dated a few
If I'mma take a chance on love, I thank God he let me take it with you
I love you


You and I, you and I seem crazy
I would die, if you leave my life baby
No one else gave a damn 'bout us
Where we go, I don't know the future
I just know, I don't wanna lose ya

Bad news, it can just stay away
If you ain’t got anything good to say
Then shut your mouth
I got my windows down and my blinders on
Radio set to my favorite song

Man, there ain't no doubt


I’m getting them good vibes
I'm living this good life
I'm breathing on God's time
And I ain't gonna waste one breath
I'm soaking it all up

Nothing gonna kill it
Waving them worries goodbye
I'm feeling them good vibes


I ain’t tryna hear the negative
I’m just tryna change the narrative
It's simply imperative

Hank Thompson,How Many Teardrops Will It Take,country,"How many teardrops have fallen over you
How many lovers couldn't last
You loved me for this moment and perhaps a day or two
Then suddenly I'll fade into your past


I'm not in the mood for crying but perhaps I should prepare
My tears are standing by just in case I learn to care
To cure a heart that's broken if I make the same mistake
Tell me how many teardrops will it take




I know their feeling each one who held you close
There'll come a time I know you'll find someonе you'll love the most
And then if you should losе him and amends you try to make

Yeah, yeah, real one
Yeye, uh
Look, uh look

I'm about to be a dad again
I'm 'bout to have another kid, I have to brag again
And now my woman's freaking out
'cause we ain't got a house and I ain't got a job
I think her mom's about to kick me out
And just the other night I cried
Tears shed with my woman layin' by my side
'cause I felt guilty that I'm a man that can't provide
But inside
Man inside, inside
I know it isn't only pride
But the music really saved my life
So should I really put the music in the backseat?
I think that's counterproductive man if you ask me
Slowin' down while my life is catchin' up with me
When I'm just gettin' started here and ain't nobody fuck wit' me
I'm tryna show my kids a different path of life
I'm tryna get all my shit together just to show it to 'em right
I nearly jumped off a bridge last night
Because I couldn't see the light
Now I'm finally getting better cause I found the mic
I'm hella confident but just don't know
Because the stress is really piquing when the funds get low but hey
I know that's just the way it goes my bro
But any way yo, what's up witchu?

Aight, listen
Big homie you’re not alone
I know a lot of us be crossing and stomping upon the same road
Surely many rock n tipping up off the same boat
I reassure that you are not alone
In fact me and my beautiful be struggling the same
Tryna reach the fantasy being financially OK
Part of the blame be upon the world that got us enslaved
Got em thinkin' “normality” guess it’s just part of the game
Never stop
I resigned to shoot a shot I got with the king of RnB lives down the block, (Hunnid)
If anything
You the man and it be hard to understand the lives that’s depending up on your hands
I know we can
Cope with the realness
Life is hard to deal with
Free your mind with the music let it be your pineal, foreal
You and your lady with another baby on the way
God exists and he’s shaping you for a brighter day
Cos in this God made world and man made life
Don’t ever trip hear me out we’ll rock these mics
So never doubt it please
We gone see I preach in the next few we're laughing looking back to this beat

Yeah, look
To keep it honest
It's usually a difficult thing
For me to open up and talk about the simplest things
So simple it seems
Guess that's why I hit yo phone
'cause I don't know if I can handle all this shit on my own
And I don't want my girl to worry while she pregnant and shit
Like I don't know, what if the baby get's affected and shit
If she's stressin' over my depression?
Like, maybe not but I ain't tryna learn that type of lesson
And I been walkin' 'round passive aggressive
But now I know it's not okay and I have to be better
'cause you the one that said that now they're dependin' on me and I know that I can handle this pressure
I can handle the smoke
I can handle the stresses, and I
I understand the type of struggle you been dealin'
Like when you're in the studio you feel like you been missin'
A part of you because the heart of you is at a distance
The woman that you're missing is the reason why you're on a mission
And honestly, everybody needs a why
A reason why they wake up in the morning just to try
To open up they eyes for a 40-minute drive
To the 9 to 5, everyday we struggle to survive
But the why
Is stronger than material shit
And I don't really give a fuck if they be feelin' this shit
But I just needed you to know that I was weaker but I'm better now
And yo I might need your help to get it together now
Keep it a hunnid you as real as it get's
Because I nearly didn't tell you all the shit that I said
But there's a reason why I'm here and no I ain't done yet
And I ain't never givin' up
I can't ever forget, uh

Because I know that it can be like that
That sometimes it can be like that, (yeah, uh)
I said I know that it can be like that

Conway Twitty,Fallin' for You for Years,country,"Lookin' at us they'd think that we just met
And only been in love a night or two

In the shadows with a man
And all they see is a weekend rendezvous

Guess we look like cheaters?
Lover's lyin' low?
We must be decievers
'Cause baby they don't know

I've been fallin' for you for years
Can't get over the feel of you

Runnin' deep, runnin' strong

You make it easy to be a one woman man
Just look at you sitting there

The Judds,Love Is Alive,country,"Love ain't a candle
It doesn't burn for one night
And need the dark to shine
Love is alive

And love ain't just a word
In every dictionary
With no where defined
Love is a man and he's mine


Love is alive
And at our breakfast table
Every day of the week

Love is alive
And it grows everyday and night
Even in our sleep

Love is alive
And it's made a happy woman out of me
Oh, love is alive
And here by me


Love ain't just a mood
A distant far away dream
That needs the night to rise
Love is alive

Christian Lee Hutson,Strawberry Lemonade,country,"(Laugh)

In a dream drinking strawberry lemonade
Feeding quarters to a pinball game
And getting paid to look the other way
My foam finger slapped me right in the face

I bang my head on the plexiglass
I can't remember where my house is at
And this Moms Against Drunk Driving ad
Keeps playing on a loop in the back of the cab

Oh, what a pitiful hill to climb
Every night of my evil fucking life
208 to the end of the line
I swear I'm really done this time

I said goodbye to my oldest friend
Could barely string together sеntences then
A hundrеd dollar bill folded into his hand
I'll see you on the other side of the fence

I need headphones to fall asleep
I close my eyes and I pretend to be
In my little room on Rossbury
Step-dad reading Treasure Island to me

And visit people that are gone in your mind
And smooth over every wrinkle you find
The truth can't hurt you if you know it's a lie

I've had this thing that Joan said to me
Circling in my head the last few weeks:
""We were raised on dreams that keep
Turning our fingers green""

A baby boomer's last acid trip
Pushing up a casket lid
Just some jacaranda petals in a basket
Wrapped up in plastic

Everything is an accident
God's truth is elastic
We sent him a man to the moon and back again
Strapped into a trash can




There's a consolation prize
In the corner of my mind
There's a consolation prize
In the corner of my mind
There's a consolation prize
In the corner of my mind:
I will always be your friend"

Well hello honey face it, reality as come to call

You're gonna cry, cry baby

You're gonna get a little close up of what I've been feeling lately
But all I can tell you, is cry cry baby

Now there ain't no way to take this like a man
So you best prepare yourself the best you can
While your out there drowning in a sea of pain
There's just one thing for certain

Sing Away the Blues"
Amy Ray,Rural Faggot,country,"You ride your John Deere down to the pond
Just to watch me struggle along
You say you got your daddy's seed in you
And you think you're bored with anything there is to do with me

You wipe your hands across your bare chest
And rub your fingers through your crew cut hair
""Expelled from school,"" you tell me with a grin
""I copped a feel from an ex-girlfriend.""

I know you want to break the rules-
We were made by nature's fools
And so you ride all day long, all by yourself
'Til you feel strong-

Strong enough to stay
Strong enough to be
Standing in the way
Of everything I see

You wanna know why I had to go
Down to the baseball park to see you blow it
All the balls just fall from your hands
And your daddy asks me, ""When is he gonna be a man?""

I know you want to change the truth-
We were made by nature's fools
So you ride all night long
With your boys in those muscle cars
And you go down to the city
And laugh at the faggots
Until the girls look pretty and until you feel strong-
You might also likeStrong enough to stay
Strong enough to be
Standing in the way
Of everything that you could see

I'm just a magnet for the rural faggots
They come and knock on my door
Just to find they're running out of time
To figure out what they come here for

I know you want to know the truth
And I'm the dyke who will give it to you
By this time next year
You'll know you're queer
It'll all be okay
It'll all be clear
And you'll run away from home
But not to be alone
And you'll go down to the city
Where the boys are pretty

And where you feel strong
Strong enough to stay
Strong enough to be"
Jill Johnson,God Bless A Girl In Love,country,"God knows it's hard to be sweet
When a man like you watching me
Lord knows it's hard but I try
To have the way I feel but I
Still get weak in my knees
Got to get this heart up off my sleep, but I
Can't help myself from falling
Got me swept of my feet
Fell hell band for lover
The word's out, it's on the street
Fell hell band for lover
Got me sure got me good
Lord I pray, I pray each day
God bless a girl in love
Trust me I'm not what I seem
I don't act like this usually
You bring the fool out of me
I don't get the joke but I laugh cause I
Want you to think that I do
I try so hard to keep my cool but I
Can't help myself from falling

Randy Travis,From Your Knees,country,"He tore down the work of seventeen years
Brick by brick and stone by stone
No hammer was swingin' 'cause cheatin' and drinkin'
Don't need no help wreckin' a home
Ah, but when he came back through the dust and the rubble
Of what he had once called his life
He dropped to his knees in sheer disbelief
Of the total destruction inside
There were empty closets and empty drawers
And a tear stained note on the kitchen floor
And burnin' memories in the fireplace
He waited too late to say he was wrong
His house was still standin' but his home was gone
Brother you would not believe
What you can see from your knees
Right then and there in an old sinner's prayer
He told things he'd kept in the dark
There was no use in lyin' 'cause the man who was listenin'
Could see every room in his heart
Ah, he took empty whiskey bottles, little black book and all
To the fire she left on the grate
Ah, sometimes a man will change on his own
But sometimes I tell you it takes
Empty closets and empty drawers
And a tearful confession on the kitchen floor
And burnin' memories in the fireplace
He waited too late to say he was wrong
His house was still standin', he'd fight for his home
Brother you would not believe, oh you would not believe
What you can see from your kneesSee Randy Travis LiveGet tickets as low as $69You might also like"
Hot Tuna,Serpent Of Dreams,country,"Flowers today bloomin' by the pathway
Linin' the edge of tomorrow's grave
Bright shinin' way, livin' in the shadows
Tryin' to be the master of tomorrow's slave

Down in the mine, circled 'round a diamond
Serpent of your expectations sleeps a nervous dream
Circled so fine like a velvet palace
Whiles away the passing hours, not being what he seems

Then he creeps into the night speeding up like fire flight
How he moves into the forest floor
Send away the pace of time, leave behind the lonely mine
And the diamond silent on the floor

We cannot stay by the crystal mountain
The serpent of dreams has left his shadow lair
The diamond remains brilliant in its cavern
No one to see and no one left to care

The serpent's friends have come and gone
Down the hills, they're movin' on
Through the lakes and forests and the dale

They will find tomorrow's rise
Brings them all the bluest skies
Frees the lonesome banshee and his wail

Billy Walker,She Goes Walking Through My Mind,country,"She goes walking through my mind

I've tried to drive away her memory
But each night it comes back to torture me
Cause once again there she is right on time
When she goes walking through my mind

She goes walking through my mind
Tearing out a little each time
Her footsteps are getting louder all the time
When she goes walking through my mind

I've tried to drown my thoughts in the wine
But a glass full of heartaches all I find
Cause once again there she is right on time
And she goes walking through my mind

She goes walking through my mind
Tearing out a little each time
Her footsteps are getting louder all the time
When she goes walking through my mindYou might also like"
Ashley McBryde,Straight Tequila Night,country,"If you really wanna know, she comes here a lot
She just loves to hear the music and dance
K13 is her favorite song
If you play it, you might have a chance


Tonight, she's only sippin' white wine
She's friendly and fun lovin' most of the time


Don't ask her on a straight tequila night
She'll start thinkin' 'bout him and she's ready to fight
Blames her broken heart on every man in sight
On a straight tequila night


Here's a glass of Chablis, some quarters and change
Maybe you can turn her love life around
Then she won't need the salt or the lime anymore
To shoot that old memory down


Just remember her heart's on the mend
So if you ever come back and see her again
